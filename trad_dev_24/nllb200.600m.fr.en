No, the product has not suffered any physical damage, it may very well be a material problem on the electronic part. 
The product is under guarantee and covers the material problems.
I'm not satisfied with this answer, I'm really sorry for that.
I think that the problems of display are related to a problem of material order suite to a dysfunction at the electronic level. 
Unfortunately, this is a common problem.
A reunification as you have proposed to me is not able to repair this type of problem.
I'm really sorry, but I'm very dissatisfied with your answers.

According to all the evidence there is an electronic problem.
