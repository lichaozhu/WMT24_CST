Hello I just bought a #PRS_ORG# reader and I only have access to English books and prices in dollars while I am in France
#EMAIL#
I haven't used or bought an e-book yet because I received it as a Christmas present
I can't order the prices are shown in dollars
What should I do?
Can I do this from my smartphone?
Do I have to log on to my computer then?
Or my e-reader?
Okay, thank you.
Another problem when I search for a title on the site #PRS_ORG# it does not find it.
Ex: thousand white women
Because of billing information?
At the moment I couldn't find a single title!!!
Another example LA PANTHERE DES NEIGE the shop does not know
Okay, I'll follow your advice and I'll see.p
Thank you

That's it...

I wrote to you first to find out if we could go to the #PRS_ORG# to show them the problem and change it.
If I had known I would have gone to buy it directly in the store....
Even if you change the cable, it won't change the problem of the button that you can't push
You can send it to #EMAIL#.
thank you

Can we replace her in a #PRS_ORG# store?
It would be simpler and we would have it right away

Hello.
I'm contacting you about a problem I have with an ebook.
This is the ebook "Alice in #PRS_ORG#".
In this one, there was a page missing.
After contacting the publisher of this book, he told me that the problem had been solved and that by re-downloading the ebook there would be the changes.
However, that is not the case.
#EMAIL#
#NAME# - #ALPHANUMERIC_ID#
Absolutely
I use the #PRS_ORG# app on my tablet or #PRS_ORG# software on my PC
ok
I'm disconnecting
It's done
okay, i'm looking
The book opens on the application #PRS_ORG# as well as via #PRS_ORG# but I still have the same problem: pages 56 and 57 are duplicates and so I miss a page.
However, the publisher confirmed to me that he had made the change.
I have the same problem whether the file is downloaded via the #PRS_ORG# app or with the #PRS_ORG# app.
I'd prefer you to say thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
No, it'll be all thanks.
Good day to you, too.

yes
We can read the book on #PRS_ORG# but not copy it to #PRS_ORG#
"The Complicated Life of #NAME# Volume 13.1" by #NAME#
If I create another different #PRS_ORG# account on another computer (#PRS_ORG#), will I be able to transfer to #PRS_ORG# or does it take 2 identical accounts on the computer and #PRS_ORG#?
as we start (only 1 rented book) the important thing for us is to be able to use #PRS_ORG#
So all the books have to come from a #PRS_ORG# account of that usage, right?
What does the "Can't Download" message mean?
Error getting licence.
E_LIC_ALREADY_FUFILLES_BY_ANOTHER_USER"
yet they are the same
Since she couldn't copy it, my daughter is reading the book on her #PRS_ORG# book.
Is that why we can't copy it anymore?
#PRS_ORG# licence?
No, it is a book borrowed from the library of Quebec and that comes to us under link #PRS_ORG#
ok
okay, we'll do that.

Hello,
I have a recurring problem with downloading books from the library to my e-reader.
Indeed, when I download them and drag them into the file of my reader, after opening my reader, I see the downloaded file but it is black and I cannot open it.
And as much as I unauthorise my reader and authorise her again, redownload the document, nothing works.
Good spur!

i contacted one of your colleagues earlier.
I have a #PRS_ORG# 7 inch e-reader and I have a screen worry that is more lit on one side than the other.
your colleague asked me to do a reset, but that doesn't change anything
as i explained above i did it but in my opinion you have not read what i wrote
okay, i'm doing this
that's it, but unfortunately
nothing has changed.
it's weird.

Hello,
I would like to know if my #PRS_ORG# is compatible with #PRS_ORG#.
This is because it cannot be opened as under #PRS_ORG#

I have not made any purchases through the site
Only on other websites, then I added it via my pc

Yeah, that's right
But it charges
Which is kind of weird
No because it works very well under #PRS_ORG#
Yes also ^^
I tested the two USB + 4 or 5 different cables
Even if you try to use the #PRS_ORG# application, you can't configure it
All right, but I'm gonna lose all the books on it?
Okei it works, I try the manipulation during the day and contact you again if it does not work
Thank you for your creativity:)

#NUMBER# a life of Maupasser
actually i tried 2X to buy this book.
I'm reading on a #PRS_ORG# tablet and it always worked.
Please give me a solution to integrate this book into my library.
Given its low price, I will try a third cat again if necessary.
I fear the problem when buying a more expensive book...
i never need that on my other purchases.
yes, a #PRS_ORG# from #PRS_ORG#
With the #PRS_ORG# app
No it'S #PRS_ORG#
I'll try that.
Thank you for your help.
Good.
Phew, the book is downloading to my library.
Thank you so much for the help.
Thank you for the service too
The French dictionary works but not the English dictionary while it is downloaded on my #PRS_ORG#

No purchase yet.
I wanted to try on excerpts from books first.
It works in French, not in English
Okay
You find?
#PRS_ORG#
#PRS_ORG#
I just installed it four hours ago.
How do we update it?
He says he can't find the word in the dictionary and to look for another one.
But it doesn't work.
No error message per se
The French dictionary works
Okay
I've tried it before but I'll try again...my Christmas present disappoints me
It's gonna take a little time
A little more patience...
Turning it off and on does not work.
I'm looking at your other instructions
It works!
Thank you bcp 😉
I'm very happy but I hope I don't have any more adventures.
Good night!
Okay.
Very Positive!!
on last book #NAME# does not display the Font icon.
Unable to adjust text on the #PRS_ORG# reader.
How can I please?
Cannot read as is, lowercase characters if the page is retracted to the screen.
Thank you.
The one indicated, namely:
#EMAIL#
One last lap of the track
O;K; perfect, I'm waiting.
I did
It's the same, still no green font icon when I look at settings, there are only those of the reading
If I read on the computer, it is the same.
i think the format of the book is not good yet i bought it from #PRS_ORG#.
Yes, I am page 15
This icon does not appear on this book but on the others yes.
The problem is, I can't fix either the style or anything.
I bought this book at #PRS_ORG#.
On my account #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG#
So what do I do?
It is indicated that it can be read on the application #PRS_ORG#
Okay, I'll wait.
Thank you
YES but by zooming in impossible to fix the page, it is too big or too small and offset either to the right or to the left.
Thank you, it's amazing not to see the police icon.
How do I delete it and then possibly reload it at no extra cost?
Just cancel it from my library and then download it again to see if it's the same or fixed.
If possible, I will return it and take the paper version.
It must be a defect in the realisation of the e-book because on the previous one, it works normally
I just reset it and I can’t close it.
I have to weigh very long and several times and when I pass the image of the book remains displayed with the word switched off
I was already in conversation with #NAME#

I can't close my e-reader
See photo
I was telling #NAME# that I got the e-reader at Christmas she doesn't want to close and also I have to keep my finger on the button for a very long time and I have to do it several times before it closes
Plus it freezes and we can't even close it
It took at least 15 minutes before we managed to close it
I can go on with you
#PRS_ORG#
It has already been done, and nothing has changed.
It is normal to always have the screen open when closed
You saw the picture
Why?
It uses the battery
I'd also like to know why we have to keep the button pressed long before it opens
Okay, just a moment
Will this not affect my reading?
If I ask for 15 minutes, will this be closed after 15 minutes of reading?
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
If I still have problems because it's still frozen, do I return it to the store?
Yes.
I try to shut up and she doesn’t want to.
I can keep my finger on it, but nothing can be done.
I have to do this operation more times
Thank you for everything and have a good evening

hello again, it didn't work
neither step
yeah, it's done
i select only one word

i've tried several.
An easy word like 'mañana' for example
and I added the Spanish-English dictionary
yes
but no words
every word i click on, i'm told 'no definition found'
oh no, it's because i'm reading a book in spanish
i have two in spanish, both, and the same thing happens
i'm not sure i understand your question—
i press the word and a window appears that refers me to the dictionary that i have installed, which does not work
it still doesn't work
an e-reader #PRS_ORG#
The book I just bought doesn't appear in my app?
#EMAIL#

I'm really happy
No, thank you very much for your time and patience
Happy New Year #NUMBER#
I created an account #PRS_ORG#, which tells me that this account already exists and refuses my password even when I change it.
I don't want to create an account with another email, what do I do?
PS I forgot that I had created a #PRS_ORG# account on my iPad a long time ago
#EMAIL#
welcome to place beauvau
it was free
i don't know; i've had it on my ipad for a long time
#PRS_ORG# has opened up, so it seems to me that it's working.
I'm on my PC.
Now I'll have to see on my e-reader if it works!
thank you bcp for your help.
to you as well.
Courage for work on public holidays!
hello, i added the number indicated on my e-reader to the site #URL#.
But I need to associate this #PRS_ORG# account via #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG#: can please tell me which address I need to put for #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG#?
that's what i did, but it's not accepted.
I'll try again
that's my deal, what do i have to do now for the Ebooks in my #PRS_ORG# to appear in my e-reader (#PRS_ORG#)?
on my e-reader, I synchronised, but I don't see the 2 ebooks that are in my dropbox
i followed until the sixth, and after that, what account is it?
i do all the manips again
connection with #PRS_ORG# denied: tells me that this email address is already in use!!!
reader / #PRS_ORG# loading i don't know what.
Asks me to wait
i despair!
for now the e-reader is blocked, a load is in progress.
In fact, I am on a page #PRS_ORG#, under the title it is written: Last update/24 August 2020.
but i just bought my #PRS_ORG# e-reader...
That's it, I come back to Login with #PRS_ORG#
so i'll put my email and my password
account not found: i'll make password forgotten
it works: your opinion please?
#PRS_ORG# asks me if I agree to share my personal info with #PRS_ORG#?
thanks!well, it didn't work, transferring books from #PRS_ORG# to my eReader.
Only one came from the #PRS_ORG#.
The others are probably coming
You helped me well, I won't bore you + long, but I thought it was possible to add Ebooks on the #PRS_ORG# reader regardless of their origin.
I'll be very disappointed if that's not the case.
I'll go to the floor and read the technical info, and maybe go to #PRS_ORG# for clarification.
Thank you very much and have a good evening.

Thank you very much. You're nice

Pressing the book tells me: cancel the download?
The disconnect is happening
It's not over
I have a problem with the password

Hello!
I borrowed two books from the municipal library, as I do regularly.
When I try to read on my e-reader, a message appears saying "Your e-reader is not allowed to open this book.
This book is protected by #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#).
Having previously disabled your eReader, you must re-import it using #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#)."
I can see and open the book on my computer through the reader's device, but I can't read it on the device.
What to do?
My associated account is #NAME#
I haven't bought a book recently and I don't think I've ever bought one yet...
Okay, I'll try.
Thank you!
Are you still here?
It still doesn't work.
Is there another possible solution?
Could I ask why I'm not getting an answer, please?
Hello!
I managed to do the steps, but unfortunately they didn't solve the problem.
That's what I did as well.
The problem persists.
So I have to go back and borrow it again?
Unfortunately, it doesn't work.
However, I am able to open the books in the library on the computer and on the device.
It only doesn't work when I unplug my e-reader.
ok
Will I receive instructions on the chat or by email?
#PRS_ORG#
Do you need the model number?
#PRS_ORG#
Is it normal that I haven't received anything yet?
Okay, thank you for your help!
Hopefully it will work!
Do I have to leave the conversation myself?
Have a good evening!
Hello, I tried several times to buy you 2 eBooks.
It's blocking the check every time
#EMAIL#
I bought the #PRS_ORG# today.
I'm trying to buy you the first eBooks, but it always gets stuck in the check
No, no, no.
When I want to finalise the purchase, there are images to recognise that appear.
I tick them off and then nothing happens.
It never goes to stage three.
I put together my basket.
I'm pressing "settlement"
Then finalise the purchase
I recognised all the images of the boat, but it doesn't go any further.
I have no error messages
Here I disconnected my e-reader.
I'll try again tomorrow.
Thank you for your help.

Apparently it happens, but it is not normal that it is so I just bought this device!
Strange because I'd already bought a book...
He disappeared again.
I'll do the manoeuvre again... we'll see.
Otherwise I go back to the seller!
Yeah, but I have to leave now.
I'll be back.
Beautiful day
Good evening,
I made a disconnection and a reconnection and it didn't work.
I created a new account.
Same result.
I even uninstalled #PRS_ORG# without success.
As a last resort, do you think that resetting the device would solve the problem?
#EMAIL#
I don't have a book in my account.
I use my tablet to borrow books from the library in my neighbourhood.
Are you asking me which reader I have?
If that's what it's called #PRS_ORG#
Just a moment, I'll check.

All right, all right, all right

On the e-reader

Okay.

It’s done.
Do I have to try to open a book or do I have to synchronise first?
Ah finally the synchronisation is done automatically.
It says “downloading content”
It's okay!
It's working.
Yes, both books.
Thank you very much for your help.

Thank you, and have a good day!
Thank you!

Hello,
I bought the Ascendance of a bookworm Part 3 Volume 3 ebook.
When I upload it to my e-reader (via the #PRS_ORG# app), the book I retrieve is only a preview and not the entire book.
I tried to delete it and download it again, and I get the same result every time.
How do I download the correct book?
Thank you
#EMAIL#
Please note that I make purchases through the #PRS_ORG#
That's the one and it was January 4
This is a #PRS_ORG# e-reader
#PRS_ORG# if I remember correctly
yeah, that's it
Is that on the e-reader's menu?
I don't see that option.
OR do I have to do it in the #PRS_ORG# app on my pc?
Oh yes I see it in the app, I launch it
It's done
Ah yes, thank you, I had not looked in the device information but rather in the account section
The book remains unchanged for the moment however, do I have to delete it and re-download it?
It's done
I logged out on the app and reader side, waited 3 minutes and logged back in just on the app for now
i use the app to retrieve the books on the e-reader because i have wi-fi connection problems with it
On the app side, it has finished resynchronising, but the book is unchanged
He's there, but it's still the preview and not the whole book, nothing has changed
After logging back in, I didn't do any manipulation on that particular ebook, but the app looks like it has re-downloaded at least some of them by itself
Do I delete it and download it again?
Sorry, I started doing this before I saw your message
The ebook is here again, I'm waiting for your message before touching up anything
i'm offline
the synchronisation is over, always the same
The book is incomplete, it is only an extract and not the whole book
the ebook opens (and it has always opened), but the content is not the entire book
here, on the app
but on monday i picked it up from the e-reader and it was the same
No, I didn't connect it while we were doing the manoeuvres
I can connect it if necessary, but if the book doesn't appear properly in the app, I guess it will be the same on the e-reader
I'm just in the table of contents with Cover and Preview, and it's only 25 pages
uninstalled, reinstalled, no changes
I don't think the concern is in my installation, considering the comments on the book in the shop I'm not the only one with this problem
No change
Okay, I tried to contact them first and I couldn't
Yeah, that makes sense
Thanks anyway, have a good day
I bought the "Fire Force tome 12" ebooks.

Bjr, I ordered books this morning (as usual) but this time I only have 4 books (already old) instead of the dozen bought recently.
What???
#EMAIL#
Last purchased today January 13 #NUMBER#
Oh, please
From memory this morning 5 (o 7) and last week as much...
In all 15 recent books that I no longer have access to on my e-reader.
The remaining 4 are much older
I'm sorry, I was checking the books for the #PRS_ORG# account and the e-reader.
I'll disconnect and get back to you right away
What is the eaeder account?
Yes, but now I'm worried because the following message just appeared: your library is empty....
I'll try your hand
I did the hand and the result: "Connection..."
Underneath dimmed "Cancel Repair" LAST SYNC: 4:01 PM
On which device?
my e-reader doesn't care...
Okay, I'll try.
I'll keep you posted
You've done miracles.
Thank you very much.
It seems to be working again
I'll know what to write about your customer relationship qualities.
Thank you again.

Yesterday I discussed this problem with your colleagues
I usually read about the app
And when I went to the site he told me that it is not possible to buy the book in Guadeloupe
Book name dream team 23 and 24
I bought the book on #PRS_ORG#
For your information I have a #PRS_ORG#
Is it the same thing?
I already had the opportunity to do so yesterday and no change
I'll try again anyway
I just did it and no change
Okay, I'll try
Can I log in right away?
Okay
No change
Okay
Still nothing
How do I do it?
Deco\reco?
Nothing
I don't know if it's because it's a book you can't buy in Guadeloupe.
When I look at the sequel that I managed to download it does not show me this message
I just did it no change
Okay
No
Thank you
Hello
i can't access the books in my library in french.
With #PRS_ORG#, I only have access to books in English
and

Hello
The On/Off button on my new e-reader doesn't work.
Can you make a standard exchange?
Thank you
#NAME#
i used #EMAIL# signing in with my #PRS_ORG# account
That's right: I can't turn off the e-reader and the sleep/wake function doesn't work every time
it was purchased through c-discount, which refers me to your customer service
no internet commerce
#PRS_ORG# - 8" - 300dpi - #PRS_ORG# - Waterproof
yes

I can't download the invoice, there's always an error message.
sorry the full address is #ADDRESS#
in France it is useless: the postal code #NUMBER# indicates that it is the Ile-de-france
of course, i thank you for your help.
Excellent day to you too, thank you
I have a #PRS_ORG# and I no longer have the PIN to unload the e-reader and the #PRS_ORG# site does not tell me the right solution to replace the PIN
#EMAIL#
For too long without using it and my daughter would like to use it
#ALPHANUMERIC_ID#, gift from #PRS_ORG# company back when my daughter-in-law worked there
The home screen is blocked and requires a PIN to open access to the reader.
It is impossible to do anything without this PIN and I would like to leave the reader completely
The reader's home screen is crossed out
I don't understand because the USB cable is the cable used for wall connection and cannot be connected to my computer at the same time!
There are no two connections to the e-reader!
But the screen is still locked and I can't do anything without having the PIN.
How can I reset without the PIN?
Give me the exact steps so I can try to leave with the factory settings!
Shall I continue with you?!
I did this step but the restore screen does not appear!
Hello,
On 12/24, I bought a #PRS_ORG# e-reader.
From the first use, I noticed a problem, the screen tends to "jump" that is to say become a black instant and then come back.
It does so as soon as you change pages or in the menu.
I went to see the seller who noticed the problem but the service procedure refers me to you.
What to do?
#EMAIL#
Yes every time I go on the screen go black for a few seconds then go back to normal
I saw with the VAS and the salesman who told me that it's not normal
The #PRS_ORG#, the CDiscount corner
Yes, I took everything as I also work there I know the procedure.
The SAV procedure says to contact the supplier directly and it was the last one in our stock.
All right, all right, all right
There's the sync symbol and it charges
As soon as the switch on and the choice of language started again
With each manipulation the screen becomes black for a few moments
#ADDRESS#; #PHONENUMBER#; #PRS_ORG#!
Is it not possible to make a refund in my store?
Okay, but for a refund, the store needs the agreement of the supplier.
I'm just scared of falling back on another faulty product!
Okay, a replacement, and I'll send this one back to you?
Can you send me a return label?
And I'll send it to you as soon as I get the other one?
No Thanks
Thank you very much, have a good day as well
Hello,
i can't reset my #PRS_ORG# account password: i have an error message telling me that my password can't be the same as my id when it isn't...
#EMAIL#
I haven't bought anything yet on the site: I just got a reader #PRS_ORG#
Okay, thank you
but i can't associate it with an account #PRS_ORG#
through the #PRS_ORG# account?
don't i understand?
When I log on to #PRS_ORG# through my #PRS_ORG# account I cannot associate an #PRS_ORG# account
but when i'm on the #PRS_ORG# website i don't see how i can access my #PRS_ORG# account
so it's the same password?
i just did it but trying on the e-reader afterwards, i still can't log in with #PRS_ORG#
it makes me count not found
that's exactly what i did but the #PRS_ORG# account doesn't work
yes

i received it today
is there a special list because i follow the indications, i choose a book and i am told that the code does not work or has expired.
What to do?
browse the list and i come to the page of the library ...no special list ...do we give or not?
do i have to go to this address?
DISAPPOINTMENT: it's all English books yet my account is in French...
you're good at taking money but stingy in your supposed gifts ...very disappointed again ...thank you for your efforts, it's not your fault but if you can convey this message to your boss...surely it won't stop him sleeping but well...
And thanks again for your efforts.
Do I have to go to the site for the book?
I really appreciate your help.
Happy end of the day and happy new year to you
I can't put a book on my #PRS_ORG# anymore.
#EMAIL#
i've never bought a book.
Let me explain.
When I download a book from my municipal library, my reader sends me an error message.
My reader writes: Your reader is not allowed to open this book.
This book is protected by #PRS_ORG# digital rights management.
Having previously disabled your eReader, you must re-import it using #PRS_ORG#.
yes
I reset my e-reader, by the way, and it was going to fix the problem.
#PRS_ORG#
#NUMBER# (#ALPHANUMERIC_ID#, 09/11/2020)
I allow both from #PRS_ORG#.
I was already talking to someone, but she left the cat before I asked her my last questions
I'd like to delete all the books in #PRS_ORG#, but I can't.
I erase them and when I reopen #PRS_ORG# they come back
I delete via #PRS_ORG# and when I open they are still #NAME#
there
I removed the permission on my e-reader and in #PRS_ORG#.
I closed my e-reader and I'm going to open it again.
Actually, that's the stage I don't know
3
Delete all files from eBooks on your computer, even from the trash can.
You will need to ask your library to reset the #PRS_ORG# licence of the eBook and request a new copy of the eBook
Do you want me to contact my municipal library?
I tried with another reader and it works
it's my reading machine that's the problem.
i try with a lot of books and no book works.
But it works with another e-reader.
I think the problem is with my e-reader and not with the licence.
it doesn't work
your e-reader is not allowed to open this book
This book is protected by #PRS_ORG# digital rights management.
Having previously disabled your eReader, you must re-import it using #PRS_ORG#.
It's really weird because it's been working for two years and now it's not working
i didn't change anything.

can you refer me to someone in the mauricie?
ok
It's been four times I've connected with someone and my problem persists.
I understand.
I'll try again and get back to you next time.

I can’t open the books in my eReader since I made an update.
I am given a message that the books are protected by #PRS_ORG# digital rights management and that I need to allow my e-reader again with my #PRS_ORG# ID.

I don't want to subscribe or create accounts I just want to read my books what's the problem???
#EMAIL#

Hello?
How do I do that?
1- you say open #PRS_ORG# .
Do I open it or?
On my computer?
1- You say you open #PRS_ORG#.
2- you say to delete the file from #PRS_ORG# in my documents: i don't have that on my computer and even if i had it why do i have to open it and delete it?
3- you say unauthorise the computer: do i have to plug in the e-reader at the same time?
4-i don't have a #PRS_ORG# account
Why can't I open my books on my e-reader?
I don’t want to pay for #PRS_ORG# I don’t need it.
Since the update I have problems before I didn’t have any
It's free?
I can open them on my computer without any problems
I had no problems before now that I made the update I can no longer open documents these are school PDF documents they are not protected!
#NAME# is free?
I will try what you suggested earlier.
If there's a problem, I'll get back to you

No, thank you, good evening
I have a problem with my #PRS_ORG# on/off button.
You have to press hard and long to turn it on or off.
We exchanged it this morning and we have the same problem.
Please note that we already have two more #PRS_ORG# purchased in 2019 and have not experienced this problem.
What do we need to get her back again?
Thank you for your help.

But it's not on this e-reader, nor my wife's, that we have the problem, but on a third one that we offered our son-in-law!
None of this, as I indicated the third e-reader was exchanged this morning and has the same problem, you have to press hard and long to turn the e-reader on or off
Not at all, this 3rd e-reader is a gift.

I just checked my e-mails, but I didn't get anything
Sorry but at my email address #EMAIL# I didn't receive anything.

i've bought 3 more since but don't have the confirmation email on hand
i am in volume 12 (finished)
thank you
ok
none of this works: the reader charged all night (well, she was plugged in to do it but i don't know if she charged).
And the 2 mania indicated do not work.
either it no longer charges, or the on/off button no longer works

can i get a record of the exchange to keep track of it?
ok
thanks goodbye
I don't see it
I asked twice to exchange a case for what I had bought for my wife's e-reader but I don't know how yet I don't want to be reimbursed but only exchange the case because it is too small  
yes
the coverage it currently has at 5 inches by 7 inches but what i received is too small i ordered from you because i found it simpler but i don't see it like that now
order number #ALPHANUMERIC_ID#
Yes, I would like to think that a commander of the company even I would have the right case
not yet because i thought i might have the right one for you #NAME# #ALPHANUMERIC_ID# reading case #PRS_ORG#

take your time we have a lot of free time for those who don't work anymore
Yes
but i don’t have a printer
no, you can't send me the labels to send it back
I don't understand
Thank you, but that doesn't help me
My problem is that I don’t have access to a printer
I will give another email address but it may take a little time thanks
i will have it sent to the following email address #EMAIL#
If I go to my email I'm going to lose the chat with you?
thank you very much for your kindness take good care of yourself
i bought a #PRS_ORG# gift card (30 euros) but the person does not receive it, yet the email address is the right one.
I've tried to fire her several times already.
#EMAIL#
December 30
the person's address is
#EMAIL# / name is #NAME#
My friend only uses a #PRS_ORG# reader, she doesn't buy anything else on the site.
if there is a pb, i prefer to be reimbursed.
Or can you credit his #PRS_ORG# account?
I've already bought #PRS_ORG# gift cards, why doesn't it work with this account?
No on #PRS_ORG# account of #NAME#
but maybe that's what you were proposing already?
Yes perfect!
indeed: #EMAIL#
my friend gave me the wrong address
this is the address of his #PRS_ORG# account that you can credit
no you can credit the #NAME# account whose correct address i just gave you
Thank you for the confusion
My friend has not yet received the 30 euros in her account
is that normal?
She's checking her account
Okay, thanks, it worked
I'm trying to open the #PRS_ORG# app on #PRS_ORG# and it doesn't work.
#EMAIL#
Where do I find that?
Aie aie
Talking with a robot, that's what it's like...
To answer your question it was December 18 #NUMBER#.
The application loads indefinitely.
By right-clicking I manage to open a menu but my purchase is not there.
I see that the application tries to load after entering my information, but it remains "empty"
No, I just see "Sign in" and a pattern that shows the app is loading
It closes the application automatically after a certain time
It is really terrible the application haha
I'll try
I have to choose it from #PRS_ORG# right?
The web link you provided to me does not load
Blank Page
None of the links/browsers work
And my Wi-Fi is OK since we communicate
#PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG#
#PRS_ORG#
Also
No
The other sites are working
Same thing when I click on the links contained in the promotional messages you send
Even in an InPrivate window
when I do #URL#, I get a message This page is not working
The Ball of the Girls
or even if i change my browser
Are you still here?
I am unable to connect to your site (still loading) to buy books.
This pb has been ongoing for a few weeks now.
/ I can't connect to your site to buy books.
#EMAIL# but it's even before I can log in
as i say, it's before i can even log in to my account, it's when i try to access your site
no i mean i can't access your site / i cannot access the site #URL#, even before i try to login to my account
it is not a problem with my account, it is a problem accessing your site&lt;
i did it, i tried in private, i tried #PRS_ORG# on my phone and it doesn't work
hello
do you prefer french or english?
French
trying to connect to #URL#, using multiple browsers (#PRS_ORG#, #PRS_ORG#, #PRS_ORG#, InPrivate window)
before i even log in to my account, i can't access your site
which means i can't buy books
it takes some time for the error message to appear
but the message says the page is not working #PRS_ORG#
This page is not working #URL# has not sent any data.
ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE
why is it necessary when it's not even when i'm trying to log in to my account
yes
yes
i can't disable it and i've managed to access it in the past
Hello, I just bought and am very disappointed, contrary to the advertised features, the #PRS_ORG# has no possibility of display in landscape mode and it is an absolutely indispensable feature for me.
I've been reading on forums that this disappeared after the latest firmware releases.
#EMAIL#
i unwrapped it today and i use repubs free of rights
Simply, regardless of the book #PRS_ORG# that is read, there is no icon to change the orientation, whereas this existed before the last firmware.
This is a known issue on #PRS_ORG# forums
That's right
ok
Everything is written above
What is your language of origin?
I'm telling you that the device had it before the updates
Not me, users of the same device in an older version of firmware
I'm telling you it is.
Besides, just add a line in the #PRS_ORG# file to re-enable it, I just read it: [DeveloperSettings] ForceAllowLandscape=true
Because you forgot to put it back in the new firmware
I see you won't help me, goodbye
hello i want to rent a book with my reader on over drive, all the beaches have been filled, but i can not get the book in question
#EMAIL#
i don't want to buy but rent
hello
i did it, but i can't get the book back, what should i do
i'm in over drive, my account is logged in, the name of the library network is there, but what do i do to get my book
borrow it
okay i'm within my #PRS_ORG# settings, i'm wi-fi
what billing,?
the information is already entered in my #PRS_ORG#, what more can i do,
okay, but how do i get there?
i'm sorry i'm not the right generation
i click account and i don't see the count setting
how to
i'm on top of #PRS_ORG#
so i have to go to the 'account' on my mobile and not the e-reader
okay, i'm clicking accounts
now what should i do?
i don't see 'my account'
it is only written 'back to store' and 'french'
i'm on the site you told me
on destop app #PRS_ORG# and I clicked the green box ' Accounts '
well i'm leaving, it's too much for me right now i'll come back later,
My #PRS_ORG# eReader purchased in March 2020 on Cdiscount no longer works
i think it's #EMAIL#
this e-reader was purchased on March 21 #NUMBER# on the Cdiscount website.
part of the screen is frozen
and there are vertical white lines that have appeared
it was fully loaded
yes, i just connected it
i can't see the top of the screen because it's "frozen", i did the manipulation and had it restored.
I restarted the e-reader but I still have a part of the screen that is frozen
no, the product has not suffered any physical damage, it may very well be a hardware problem on the electronic part.
the product is under warranty and covers hardware issues
i will not be satisfied with that answer, i am very sorry for that.
i think the display problems are related to a hardware problem due to an electronic malfunction.
Unfortunately, this is common on this type of equipment.
A reunification like you proposed to me is not able to fix this type of #URL# thanks you for taking into account this problem and giving me an adapted answer
i'm really sorry, but i'm very dissatisfied with your answers.
I bought a product less than a year ago.
In all likelihood there is an electronic problem.
I expect you to fix the e-reader, nothing else.
my device was working very well last night and was not working this morning when i woke up without anyone having touched it.
It can't be misuse of the device.
I'm afraid you're going to be forced by the contractual guarantee to consider my request for collateral.
If you are unable to process my request, please send me a mailing address where I can send a registered mail
did you read my last answer correctly?
I do not want to leave a comment on your site but send a registered mail to your service provider to assert my consumer rights.
Can you give me that mailing address?
thank you for giving me the mailing address, i will send a registered mail and we will see what happens later
no, nothing else, my 2 other #PRS_ORG# readers are working well
For the record, this e-reader is new.
I initialised it the night before last and it seemed to be working properly.
Last night, I wanted to reuse it, and that's when I found it was stuck.
#PRS_ORG# blocked in standby
Nothing's done about it. She won't light up.
It is loaded (more than 90%), and I tried the long press (more than 1 minute) on the start button, the long press on the page change button, then simultaneously on the start button.
the one requested before the chat, #EMAIL#
Hello #NAME#, do you have the info I already sent to #NAME#?
Yes
And even on lethal standby!
The e-reader is on the mains (the message “Charged 94%” is displayed under the message “Standby”).
The cover page of the most recently viewed book is also displayed with the reading percentage at the bottom of the page.
As I had already done, I realised the two proposed manipulations (I each time waited more than a minute for the button(s) pressed), and nothing does, the reader remains blocked in standby mode.
This is my first experience with a #PRS_ORG# e-reader (I used to use an android tablet), and it is catastrophic!

Thank you, that's all for today.
I have an email address in common with two readers, mine and my husband's that I am separated from. I bought a new #PRS_ORG# and I had to change my email so that it does not benefit from my book purchases. I would like to know if it is possible to transfer the books from my old email address which will remain my ex-husband's to my new email address
the new address is #EMAIL#
My ex-husband's and my ex-husband's is #NAME#
I bought the #PRS_ORG# and there is the last book of #NAME# in it it was twice
On the other email there must be about #NUMBER# books
Only thrillers
Not just the last #PRS_ORG# I want to keep the other address so that he can continue on but it bothers me to have to disconnect every time to change the email address and be able to read a book we had in common
In the end I would like to have the books of the old email address on this one without deleting the other
Count on him continuing to enjoy it
Without access to my new purchases
I would like to retrieve the books that are on the old email address without closing the account
Just a book transfer
Without changing the old email address
Yes if possible
I would sort out what I have already read
Or just what's being downloaded because the others I've already read
But I don't know if you have access to all that
It must have about #NUMBER# if memories are good to download
From #NAME# style just a shadow the complete series of #NAME# with Sharko and hennebelle
#NAME#
Sir Cedric, whom I have not read
But you really have to keep the books on the other email address so that I don't have any extra worries
Yes, without my new purchases of course
So not connected at all
So I can't read the books...
Or I have to buy them back
So if they decide to change the password, I have no access to anything
Yeah, but now it's creating more trouble between him and me
I really don't know how else to do it
Well, too bad for me
I really should go back to the problem because I think I'm not alone in this need
All right, I'll get them to tell them the problem, thank you
No thanks

I couldn't authorise the computer again.

i am constantly referred to the verification system as soon as i hit finalise payment
#EMAIL#
last purchased on 06/01 and one of the books on the list is "Colours of the fire" by #NAME#
So how do we finalise this order in progress which amounts to 54,41 € and which comprises 9 pounds?
Yes I will erase etc...
When I access my account setting: payment information I come across a page where there is nothing to update my #PRS_ORG#
Only a request for information for billing
here it is i have completed and saved my #PRS_ORG# coordinates
Again when finalising the payment I am led to repeat the verification system: type how much lorry, car, bicycle no payment made
How did the purchase of 06/01 go well and not this one?
i'm running #PRS_ORG#!
which other browser to take?
I give up it's too complicated to have to start listing the command again etc...
I'm going to go through another E-book site.
I'm disappointed that you weren't able to help me except to ask me to change my browser
Especially since it was with #PRS_ORG# that the previous purchase went well and I did not have to disconnect cookies...
here it is i have finalised my purchase through #PRS_ORG#!
Okay, thanks!
Have a good day!
i bought a second #PRS_ORG# for my wife.
How can she access my own library?
mine's #EMAIL#, my wife's not created yet, i just gave her
the tattoo artist, three times further
that is, i plug the new e-reader into my current account, without setting it up on behalf of my wife?
I set it up on behalf of my wife, with my wife's email and then plug it into my own pc?
my question is simple, not your answer...what do i do with my second reader to get access to my first reader's books?
so i plug this second e-reader into my pc?
no, because i don't know if i have to put it in my name with my own email or in my wife's name with her email?
yes and vice versa if possible
i haven't created it yet, do i have to?
so i just plug her #PRS_ORG# into my pc without doing anything else?
i have to set it up?
one last time...do I need to plug it into MY computer or HIS before configuring??
yes, which of the two ordinates?
no
yes, but your answers are not clear, and my questions are too bad
should i use my computer or my wife's computer?

#EMAIL#
advf all in one
purchased on january 10
hello #NAME#
i want to print pages
is this possible
indeed i downloaded it but it tells me a file error
it's not normal if we buy it like a book and can't print it
it is better to buy the book then
no, but is it normal that it tells me that the file is damaged
after if i buy the book the publisher is not safe that i print the pages c is incoherent
i may have mishandled it, and you can check
ha not by mail #PRS_ORG#
okay, i'm trying
indeed there are not the 3 points if i had had this info i would not have preferred the e bbok but i would have ordered the book can you make a commercial gesture to get the book i am trainer i need support for my learners who want to buy this book *
yes
that's right
yes, i understand that you can make a commercial gesture
i want to order the book so that i can receive and print it
you didn't understand
back to you for the book that wasn't on my e-reader; I had to use an account that needs to be logged off not being the right one: #EMAIL# on which I bought the #NAME# lark pepper pepper pepper pepper pepper pepper and paid 7.99 euros Order # #PHONENUMBER#
#EMAIL# but for the password I took #NAME# @4/ while the current password is #PASSWORD#
Before #NAME# I bought #NAME# in the afternoon, it worked well
i forgot the date not long ago it was a sunday
yes, the computer has been modified due to hacking and viruses, a computer friend arranged it for me, but i am a bit lost, nothing is the same
it no longer appears, but yesterday morning it was there since the computer technician deleted the wrong account and now i do not understand anything
i didn't either, but i gave you an order number that i picked up yesterday morning
yeah, because it's the last one i bought yesterday morning
So I'm waiting?
how can i help you?
but i don't know anything about it how to do the process, looking for my book???
what is an electronic reader?
Can't you call this an e-reader?
i only have one missing book and it doesn't appear anywhere on the e-reader or on my books
I try to finalise a purchase on the #PRS_ORG# app as usual but it never succeeds because after checking, as requested, the 2 series of photos of boats, planes or lorries I am always offered new series of photos to check.
It's endless!
What's the problem?
#EMAIL#
on 15/10/#NUMBER#.
yes
ok
I can't save my card because the message "Please fill out the captcha" appears.
It's all right.
I didn't check "I'm not a robot"
I'll try.
I tried.
The problem is always the same.
3 times 2 sets of photos checked without finalisation!
I only use your #PRS_ORG# app for shopping but not a server like mozilla or other.
Maybe the app is out of date?
I'll do that.
New application reinstalled.
It still doesn't work.
No more photos to check but an error message that appears " Oops, an error occurred.
Please check your payment information and try again. "
I'll try.
I was able to finalise my purchase by the site but I can't find how to synchronise my eReader with the site.
I'll do that.
It's all right.
Synchronisation succeeded.
From now on, I'll go through the site.
Thank you.
Because it took time.
Have a good day

she tells me to synchronise and then access 1 network she recognises my #PRS_ORG#   at the bottom it wrote update it does not happen and otherwise if i press add a network it is here that i arrive at a window that asks for the password 
i don't know what you mean, besides i wanted to tell you that the last sync was on 7/30:#NUMBER# when i received the e-reader
sync is done the app downloads
yes the download is advanced it is 5%
IT WILL TAKE #PRS_ORG#
YES SYNCHRONISATION IS IN PROGRESS

Hello, I can't sign in to my #PRS_ORG# account with my #PRS_ORG# ID and password.
He tells me that I already have an existing account at this same address and when I try to group the accounts, he tells me that this is not the right email address!
thank you for your help
i don't know i wanted to create a new account and it doesn't work he tells me that this email address already exists.
So I have two addresses: #PRS_ORG# which is my address #PRS_ORG# and EMAIL-1 which would already exist for #PRS_ORG# but doesn't work
I bought two books two days ago, I think
for #PRS_ORG#?
OK how?
without going through #PRS_ORG#
how?
#PRS_ORG# is asking me to access all my personal information to link the accounts and I disagree.....
Yes, thank you very much.
I haven't received the email yet
can i test now or i need to wait for the #PRS_ORG# account to be deleted?
okay, thanks to you.
i hope it will work after that!
Have a good day
on the chat i'm waiting for the answer?
ok
goodbye
How to allow my #PRS_ORG# to receive the already downloaded #PRS_ORG# book
ok
#EMAIL#
i'm taking my books from the great #PRS_ORG# library
ok
i have a new computer and i just realised that i forgot to download #PRS_ORG#; now it's done and #PRS_ORG# is compliant
but it says i have to authorise
my #PRS_ORG# taking this book
yes
my #PRS_ORG# has the message: this book is protected by #PRS_ORG#.
you must authorise your eReader
again with #PRS_ORG# ID using #PRS_ORG#
okay...
I think I have changed because this password #PRS_ORG# dates from December 31, 2020, the arrival of this new computer.
i think so because #PRS_ORG# works with my hotmail, so i wanted to keep it for the rest that goes with it
yeah, three weeks ago, i made it
I have been working for many years with 2 libraries, Mascouche and #PRS_ORG#
this is my 2nd #PRS_ORG#
if i delete the 3 l versions
i'll have to ask the library again, i'll go back
maybe it's good for #NUMBER# hours.
Where to find #PRS_ORG#
okay, one minute..... it's done
that's it, the versions of the book have all reappeared, weird
ok
how to authorise my e-reader, i authorised the computer, but it does not indicate for the e-reader....
yes
i just found him, yesss... that must have been the problem.
i'm going to try to reload the file
i have to reserve it
again at the big library, it should be okay, i dare not ask you to wait for me it will be a little long.
Thank you so much...
#NAME#, thank you, have a good day

Since I downloaded ebooks with my #PRS_ORG# card, I can no longer choose books in the discover section.
In addition, the books offered are in English.
#EMAIL#
on the #PRS_ORG# account today, on the #PRS_ORG# account on 12/25 but i have reset my #PRS_ORG# since then and i have lost them
i paid for my purchases on 25/12 with my credit card
thank you
on my #PRS_ORG#, the address is
i'm sorry, #EMAIL# though on #PRS_ORG# EMAIL-1
the two books purchased with my card were invoiced on december 25 #NUMBER# for an amount of 1.99 euros each book ordered separately (so two invoices) postal code #NUMBER#    credit card: #NUMBER#............#NUMBER#
excuse me, #NAME#
yes, i don't understand why i can't choose recent books with my #PRS_ORG#
when i put a title in the searches to discover, the #PRS_ORG# offers me books that do not match this search when i could get them before
In addition, prices are displayed in dollars
i thank you for this information, i will do it, but last question, i still have credit on my #PRS_ORG# card, this will not "disrupt" my orders?
Thank you for all that information.
So I'm waiting for the rest when my two purchased books have been found by #PRS_ORG# support.
Have a good day, cordially.
Hello, I bought more #NUMBER# books from you, I want to buy another one but your hCapchat dumb system prevents me after more than 50 tries.
You don't want my money anymore, before I paid and basta, I never had a problem, but now!
Turn off this crap so I can shop and don't talk about "customer protection".
Thank you.
#NAME#
I have a #PRS_ORG# account and in #PRS_ORG# there is my old email address it seems #EMAIL# but I'm not sure anymore
i'll see, just a moment!
Among the most recent are the OFF CAMPUS series of #PRS_ORG# and BRIAR UNIVERSITE
I'm still here
I managed to update my payment card but not my email address, since #PRS_ORG# it doesn't work.
Website
#PRS_ORG# from #PRS_ORG#
But at home I immediately come across #PRS_ORG#
Look, I'm old but not stupid, when #PRS_ORG# asks me how many cars and crosswalks or motorcycles there are on their too small Photos and I answer after verification more than 50 times, it's that the problem no longer comes from me.
I know the "I'm not a robot" system
no i'm not trying, sorry, i told you that with the site #PRS_ORG# i always come across INT.EXPLO.
Forget it, I'm the one who has to fix your nonsense so I can spend my money, as usual.
Thank you for the help trial, but it's too much:(
So #PRS_ORG# didn't receive my last Mail, wish him a good night
I am #NUMBER# years old I no longer have your speed with a keyboard and I write with a finger, let it go, thank you
I'm still here, I've reread and written down your data, but I'll take care of it tomorrow, good evening
Hello, I bought on your site on January 1st #NUMBER#, the complete UIvy Wilde from #NAME# at the Infinity Collection.
There is a problem with the file, volume 1, chapter 23 is between the 16th and the 17th.
I have contacted the Collection Infinity, which assures me that I have sent you the corrected file and that I should have received an update request from you.
I did not receive anything and I can download the book again on my e-reader, but the problem persists.
Can you please force the update so that I finally have the book with the chapters in the right order.
Thank you in advance

i sent #PRS_ORG# before janv 5, as you had asked me to
I had ordered a #PRS_ORG# in Dec.
#NAME# received #PRS_ORG# instead of #PRS_ORG#

So we had to receive #PRS_ORG# for the exchange.
But we've been waiting even longer than a week
He is or the problem
What is holding up the #PRS_ORG# post.
It's pretty simple for me,
quest what you are waiting for to post me the #PRS_ORG# i have paid for

Hello,
I created an account years ago under the email address #EMAIL# but when I log in to my #PRS_ORG#, it tells me that the account has been deactivated.
I would like to reactivate it, how do I do it?
Very cordially,
The date of purchase is very old, and in it there is the saga #PRS_ORG# for example
thank you
Is the email address #NAME#?
I bought the #PRS_ORG# in 2013 I think, I had bought #NAME# on that same occasion (Christmas) and since then I have no more purchases on it because I have not used it anymore.
Now I want to open it, it asks for my code and it tells me that my account is deactivated
There I recreated an account under #NAME# to be able to use it but I would like to find my purchases and readings under #NAME#
Thank you very much.

Good evening, I have changed my email address and the books associated with my old email address (which no longer exists) have disappeared from my #PRS_ORG# reader.
How do we find them, please?
Thank you
the old address was #EMAIL#
the news is #NAME#
Can they be merged?
good news!
The hotmail account must be deleted as this address no longer exists please
you're still here?
I synchronised but I still don't see the old books
the #PRS_ORG# e-reader

good evening
Hi, I can't force my #PRS_ORG# reader to stop.
The screen is frozen after connecting to my computer.
Thank you!
#EMAIL#
Odile and #NAME#
Thank you
Yes, that's right
It wasn't before when I plugged it into my computer to clean up my books
When I reopened it, I could see that the screen is frozen on one page of the book I am reading
I tried to force the shutdown by clicking the power button on the side, but nothing happens
No, it hasn't been loaded for three hours
When I connect it to my computer even it does not recognise my #PRS_ORG#
Yes
My computer recognised it because I was able to delete books on it
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean
Yes
That's it. It's cool
It's done and it works
I didn't lose anything, and it's all right there
Thank you very much.
Excellent service I don't regret my purchase!
To the pleasure

#EMAIL#
9 perfect foreigners
can I delete them myself?
i also have another problem: i can't get 1 ebook purchase through the e-reader
purchase made to my #PRS_ORG# account
yes
and again (sorry): the e-mail reader systematically displays an outdated e-mail address for several years and is impossible to modify
i don't understand
no
whatever the connection offered (by #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG# or not) the mail appearing on the reader remains erroneous
frozen?
he's re-registering no matter what
this email hasn't worked hacked for years i'm connecting to #PRS_ORG# with preachers
it has been done for several years
i get all #PRS_ORG# on preachers
#PRS_ORG# n uses + this address "a...." since i use preachers
what do i have to say?
neither do i
i don't understand what #PRS_ORG# has to do with this old e-mail written on the e-reader
i use preachers
good
thank you
i have deleted pdt our exchange of my bank details

the screen is less bright with the #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG# logo in the centre of the screen.
I guess it's not possible to turn it off
#ALPHANUMERIC_ID#
If your eReader does not turn off, hold down the power button until the word Off appears on the screen.
even if you stay for more than a minute, the word, , does not appear
yes
whatever i do #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG# remains on the screen
it's no longer in warranty, i'm sure

Hello,
I have grey spots on my screen on the side of my #PRS_ORG# buttons.
#EMAIL#
I haven't bought any books yet because I just received the reader this week.
I borrowed some e-books from my library.
Is it a defect of the readout grey spots in some places in the screen?
It's not very pleasant when reading.
On the screen.
No, I didn't try, but should I?
Resetting is in progress.
I still see the grey areas.
#PRS_ORG#

And then what?
How does warranty replacement work?
#PRS_ORG# in my city never has it in stock in store but only online.

Nothing received.
I'll wait.
How will it work afterwards?
I get a new e-reader and I return the faulty one afterwards?

hello,

i didn't buy a book, i'm downloading books by #PRS_ORG#
i'm transferring them from #PRS_ORG#

Good evening, I can't create a personal #PRS_ORG# account to manage the e-reader I've just been given.
My wife's account being associated with my #PRS_ORG# account, you automatically assigned me all the books in my wife's library.
How do we separate the two?
good evening, did you get my initial message?
i would like to have my own library, my wife and i do not have the same literary tastes
it's done

we're talking to you about this one
we're there, but on the help section
i am asked if i want to associate my account with my #PRS_ORG# account or my #PRS_ORG# account
now i'm lost, i haven't opened my #PRS_ORG# account
my wife's e-mail address always appears, yet the reader tells me that my e-mail address already exists
#NAME# tells me that we can't associate our 2 accounts and that my email address already exists
yes
yes
yes
i don't know how to do it
what do we do with it?
yeah, but now he doesn't recognise my email address.
Wouldn't it be easier for me to reset my eReader by creating a new account?
i think i'll turn it off and try again tomorrow, hoping my wife hasn't lost all her books.
In any case, getting started is not easy!
thank you for your help and have a good evening

While I'm with my bank's call centre, they're updating programmes related to the #PRS_ORG# D secure, this could be the cause; however I just bought a book via my pc because it worked, but actually via the PC, the payment had to be made with my token
does that mean i won't be able to buy through my e-reader?
#NUMBER# (#DEVICEID#, 09/11/2020)

Hello, long ago, I used the #PRS_ORG# #EMAIL# account to buy and download books on my ipad.
This address will no longer be used and will be deleted.
I would like to transfer points, purchases etc to my #PRS_ORG# account.
Linking accounts doesn't solve the problem because my purchases remain under the #PRS_ORG# account...
It's not the address.
But from #PRS_ORG#.
I can't change my address to sign in because these purchases are made by signing in to the #PRS_ORG# account alone.
I will no longer use #PRS_ORG# and would like to transfer my purchases to #PRS_ORG# EMAIL-1.
