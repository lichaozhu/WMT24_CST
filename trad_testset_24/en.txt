In this case, I see you have a billing address from Australia.
That's why you were charged with that currency.
Did you purchased from the Australian website?
In this case, I would advise you to update the billing address by following these steps:
#URL#
In order to not have issues, please use the address from France.
However, since you're not currently in that region, some books might not work if they have a region restriction.
We could process a refund.
Would that be okay?
If we process the refund as Store Credit you will probably have it as #PRS_ORG# because of your current address.
So if you can't change the address at the moment, I would advise the refund back to your payment method.
You're welcome.
Please let me know when the change is complete.
How is it going?
Great news!
Allow me one moment to process the refund, please.
I just processed the refund and the Store Credit has been added to your account.
However, it was added in #PRS_ORG#.
Allow me one moment so we can change it to euros, please.
I'm still with you, please bear with me one moment.
Now the Store Credit was changed to euros.
You can verify it by following these steps:

#PRS_ORG#
#PRS_ORG# is a third party app (from #PRS_ORG# not #PRS_ORG#) however we can recommend afew steps to try to correct this as advised by the source (#PRS_ORG#)
First, reset the authorization on your #PRS_ORG#
Make sure the date and time settings on your #PRS_ORG# eReader are correct.
You should find these in the Settings menu on your #PRS_ORG#.
Plug your #PRS_ORG# into your computer (using the USB cable that came with your #PRS_ORG#).
Open #PRS_ORG# on your computer.
Use #PRS_ORG# to delete the eBook that's causing issues from your #PRS_ORG# and your computer (make sure to choose the Remove from Library option).
Click on your #PRS_ORG# under the "Devices" menu on the left.
Click device options gear icon next to "Devices," then select Erase Device Authorization.
Click Erase Authorization, then OK to confirm.
Try to reset the authorization in #PRS_ORG#
In #PRS_ORG#, press Ctrl + Shift + D (Command + Shift + D on a Mac) on your keyboard.
In the pop-up window that opens, enter the password for your #PRS_ORG# ID or #PRS_ORG# account (and make sure the correct #PRS_ORG# ID is listed in the drop-down menu).
Then, click Continue.
Select Erase Authorization, then OK.
Authorize your computer again by going to Help > Authorize Computer.
Note: Make sure to reauthorize your computer using the same #PRS_ORG# ID as before.
Otherwise, you won't be able to re-download your eBook
Try transferring the eBook again
Re-download the eBook that was causing issues
Transfer the eBook from #PRS_ORG# to your #PRS_ORG#.
This step will also reauthorize your #PRS_ORG#.
Try opening the title on your #PRS_ORG#.
Note that if you have installed the version #PRS_ORG#, this may be the source of the problem.
Unfortunately, #PRS_ORG# malfunctions with certain books which are in #PRS_ORG# format at the time of transfer to the reader.
#PRS_ORG# very slightly changes the digital lock code (#PRS_ORG#), and this change is not recognized by #PRS_ORG#.
The #PRS_ORG# format is a widely used standard, but #PRS_ORG# seems to only be able to process books in the #PRS_ORG# format.
This is why with #PRS_ORG# some books are transferable and others are not.
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Nice to meet you, #NAME#.
I hope you are having a great day!
I apologize but I'm unable to verify your account with the eBook title provided.
Please provide me with an eBook purchased through your account.
You are not able to transfer an #PRS_ORG# file from your android to your eReader.
The file needs to be on your computer to be able to transfer it.
You can only import it to your #PRS_ORG#.
No, as mentioned above and it can only be transferred to your #PRS_ORG#.
To add a non-protected #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG# file to your eReader:
Turn on your eReader.
Connect the micro USB cable to your eReader and to your computer.
On your eReader, tap Connect when you see the 'Computer detected' window.
On your computer, look for a drive named '#PRS_ORG#'.
Drag the #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG# files into the '#PRS_ORG# eReader' drive.
Eject your eReader:
Right-click on the '#PRS_ORG#' drive on your computer's desktop and click Eject.
Unplug the USB cable from your eReader.
You'll see a "Importing content" message on your eReader.
To find the file you just added on your eReader:

You can download the book files to your computer in order to transfer and read them into a different device or with a different reading program.
Just bear in mind that if files are protected by #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#) they will download as the special file URLLink.ascm and will require an additional program like the free #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#) to be opened in a non-#PRS_ORG# device or #PRS_ORG# reader program.
If the files are not protected (#PRS_ORG#-Free) they will download as normal #PRS_ORG# and can be transferred to other devices without the need of additional steps.
If a book file is protected by Digital Rights or not, depends entirely of the publishers.
To download the files of your books into your computer, please follow these steps:
1
Go to #URL# and sign into your account.

However, not all the audio books in the catalog are available to download with credits
in this case the best sellers are restricted by the publisher

or Game of thrones
Those books are restricted to direct purchase by the Publisher
they cannot be redeemed with audio book credits
not really, the books in our catalog has always been restricted by the publishers in some countries and stores
You can try with this link:

The compatibility error refers to a common issue where a book available at a public library has a ProductID that is different from the one we have at #PRS_ORG# but the ISBNs are the same.
Because of this issue, the book won't sync over #PRS_ORG# and the customer might need to use #PRS_ORG# to side load the book.
Do you want me to assist you to install #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#)??
Yes it is possible, that is why we have compatibility errors sometimes.

If i understand correctly are you trying  to set up tour #PRS_ORG# ?
Is it your email password or the eReader pin?
I see, in this case you can try a manual reset but your model is an old model, we cannot guarantee that the process will work, you can try these stepsL
1
Connect your eReader to a power source by doing one of the following:
- Turn on your computer and connect the included USB power cord to your computer first, and then your eReader.
- Plug the wall charger (not included) to a power outlet, and then connect your eReader to the wall charger.
2
Press and hold the power button until the power light on the top-right corner of your eReader turns off.
You'll see a 'Powered off' screen when your eReader is turned off.
3
Release the power button.
4
Press and hold the power button on your eReader for 30 seconds.
5
Wait for the Restore screen to appear.
6
Release the power button.
Your eReader screen will turn black and begin the restoring process.
is it possible?
I continue with you
you can try the factory reset after charging the erader for at least 1 hours
As I mentioned before, you can try a manual reset but it's not guaranteed to work, press and hold your power button for 30 seconds and see if the restore page shows up
I see, unfortunately your eReader is an old model and does not support this restoration process, the only way to reactivate your eReader is by entering the correct PIN
if the restoration with the power button is possible at some time, then you can try a manual update:
Thank you for contacting #PRS_ORG#, can you please provide the email address of your #PRS_ORG# account?
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
I understand that you are having issues with the software on your brand new e-reader, correct?
This is correct, so did you get your device with a local retailer?
Have you taken your e-reader with a proof of purchase with them and explained the problem?
Ok, and why is it that you were not able to get a replacement?
Completely understand, ok, no problem.
Let's just try the following troubleshooting steps to see if the issue can be fixed>
Plug the wall charger (not included) to a power outlet, and then connect your eReader to the wall charger.
Press and hold the power button until you see the words "Powered off" at the top of the screen.
Continue holding down the power button for 3-4 seconds.
Release the power button.
Press and hold the power button on your eReader for 30 seconds.
Wait for the 'Restore' screen to appear.
Release the power button.
Great
After the e-reader has been reset, it will ask you to set your language preferences and a WiFi network.
After that you will need to sign in with your e-mail address and password
I see, don't worry, I'm happy to inform you that your #PRS_ORG# or tablet qualifies for replacement under warranty.
To proceed with the replacement, please answer all the following questions:
Name:
Street Name and number:
Apartment // Suite// Other:
City:
State/Province/Territory:
Country:
Zip/Post Code:
Telephone #:
Device name:
I am sorry, If you would like to have a refund you would need to see it directly at your store
#PRS_ORG# can only issue a replacement
Completely understand, if you would like we can start the replacement process and you would be getting a brand new device from out headquarters
If you would like to have a refund that would need to be treated directly with the store from where you got it
That's correct
You will first receive a link to validate your information
• Review your mailing information (and edit if necessary) and the replacement device being shipped to you to insure accuracy.
• Once all shipping information and replacement device is reviewed, click on “Agree” at the bottom of the screen.

I have reviewed your details
your account is provided by #PRS_ORG#
in this case you must reset your password directly from #PRS_ORG#
yes, but the main provider is #PRS_ORG#
you must use the
#PRS_ORG# credentials to access to #PRS_ORG#
so you must reset the password directly from #PRS_ORG#
no, you must reset the password from #URL# and then access to #URL# and use the new password
that's correct
Please do it directly from the website
#URL# and #URL#
and then try accessing on your ereader
do you get the same error message on the website?
can you please share a screenshot of the error message with me?
what is the login option that you are selecting?
Please select #PRS_ORG#
your provider is #PRS_ORG#
your provider is #PRS_ORG#, this is already linked to  #PRS_ORG#
that is correct
your #PRS_ORG# account is your #PRS_ORG# account
the provider is #PRS_ORG# but the profile is #PRS_ORG#
your #PRS_ORG# account is provided by #PRS_ORG#
it is partnered
it is already linked to #PRS_ORG#, if you want to have just a #PRS_ORG# profile not associated to #PRS_ORG# you must use a new email address
and create a new account but this time you must select #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG# as provider, not #PRS_ORG#
I'm sorry for the inconveniences, if you want to unlink your #PRS_ORG# profile in this account I can help you
I can create a #PRS_ORG# profile in this account so you can unlink the #PRS_ORG# account
but I would need to escalate the concern to my team, it might take a few days to be completed
your concern will be escalated to the next level of support in order to create a #PRS_ORG# profile for yoy
your reference number is #NAME#
Thank you for contacting #PRS_ORG#, it was my pleasure to assist you today.
I hope you have an excellent day.
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Nice to meet you, #NAME#.
I hope you are having a great day!
Please, allow me a few minutes to find your account.
Thank you for your patience!
Just to verify your account, can you provide me your postal code, please?
Thank you for the verification!
How can I help you?
What is the promo code you are having problems with?
Is it possible you can provide it to me, please?
Thank you so much, #NAME#!
I just found the promo code under our records and I can see it is to give you a free VIP eBook, related to the VIP membership you have on your account.
Do you were experiencing a problem using the code?
Indeed, usually when you received the promo code via email, on the same email, there is a link that will redirect you to a list of eBooks that can be added to your account  using your promo code.
If you check the email, can you see the link?
Thank you very much.
It is possible that is the list of eBooks available, but just in case, can you help me verify if your promo code works on the eBooks from this link, please:
Oh, yes please!
If it is possible for you, I suggest you try to open the link in a different browser tab so you can try to use the code while we continue our chat.
In that case, please try to use this link instead:
Sorry, that should be the exclusive list of selected eBooks we have for the VIP code in French.
No problem, #NAME#.
I am sorry to know about this and I will be happy to provide your feedback to the higher department so they can receive.
In the meantime, if you prefer, I checked the situation with my team and we could kindly add an eBook with a maximum price of $15.00 from our #PRS_ORG# website  to your #PRS_ORG# account.
If you have an eBook in mind that has a price less than $15.00, please provide me the title and author of the eBook and we can add it to your account!
And once again, I am very sorry about the list of eBooks in French being limited at the moment, I am sure  your feedback will be helpful to continue expanding the list in the future!
And thanks again for your efforts.
Do I have to go to the site for the book?
Of course!
It will be my pleasure to add this eBook to your account!
And don't worry about it, due to the inconvenience with the code and the eBooks in French, we can add it to your account without charging you the eBook at all.
Thank you for your patience!
I really appreciate your help.
Happy end of the day and happy new year to you.
You're welcome, #NAME#!
It is a pleasure to do everything we can to help you and I am so happy you can now enjoy this eBook!
And thank you very much.

Please open #PRS_ORG# again and you are supposed to be able to download the book to your computer and then copy it to the device.

Hi #NAME#
Allow me a moment to review the interaction
Yes, seems like she had some technical issues
Have you authorized your eReader and computer?
Ok, one moment please
I am sorry we con disconnected.
Are you not able to delete the files from your computer?
Please let me know if that helped.
Yes, and ask the to reset the #PRS_ORG# license of your book.
It is important for you to delete the old file of the book and download the file with the new license.
In that case you can keep the same license but please remove the files fro your computer and download the again.
Could you please let me know what does the error says?
That error message is because it is detecting a different email.
Please verify again that you are using the same email for #PRS_ORG#, your eReader and your library.
Another option is to #PRS_ORG# or use a different version of #PRS_ORG#.
Which version of #PRS_ORG# are you using?
Have you tried to use the previous version?
You'll have to de-authorize both, the device and your computer.
Then uninstall #PRS_ORG#.
Then restart your computer and install #PRS_ORG# again.
If you are able you can use the previous version of #PRS_ORG#.
We don;t have repair centers, We can assist you via chat.
You will receive an email with a copy of this interaction.
I can continue assisting you there.
Let me check your account for the books, just a moment please.
According to the system, the latest book was added in November, do you have the receipt number of the books you have recemt;y purchased?
If you haven't recieve the receipts into your email it is possible you purchased the books in a different account by mistake.
Do you have any other email address in which you might have another #PRS_ORG# account?
Ok, Do you have  login to #PRS_ORG# using #PRS_ORG#?
An user can have multiple accounts if they have different logins.
But please tell me, what is the exact issue that you are having when you purchase books.
When you finish the purchase do you get a success message that the books have been delivered to your account?
Are you sure the purchase is finished?
Can you see the books in your purchase history at the #PRS_ORG# website?
Ok, please confirm to me the title of that book, #NAME#.
Ok, the book is not in the account under the email you gave me, so it is possible you purchased it under a different account by mistake.
We will need to escalate the issue so that our Team finds the book and we transfer it to the correct account.
Can you please provide us the following information?
- Date you were charged:
- Amount:
- Postal code (The one shown on the bank statement billing address):
- First 4 and Last 4 digits of the credit card:
- Last name of the credit card holder:
Thank you #NAME#, but we need the date an amount of the missing purchase, not from an older one.
Thank you #NAME#.
Thank you #NAME#.
I will forward your issue to our Team so they can start tracking your purchase, once we have found the account where it is, we will contact you back via email, is that ok?
Ok, I will proceed to escalate the ticket so the team starts searching for the purchase.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
You can use the search feature in the #PRS_ORG# reader or the website to be shown only free ebooks.
You can also use this link to search for free ebooks at the website:
Is there anything else I can help you with?
Do not worry, our Team will look for the purchase.
If you have any other issues or questions, please contact us again.
Thanks for contacting #PRS_ORG#.
HAve a good evening.
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Are you using the #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG# app?
In this case, even when you don't have the subscription you should be able to play all the audiobooks in your account.
At the moment, #PRS_ORG# doesn't offer the Audiobook Subscription.
If you wish to subscribe again it would need to be through #PRS_ORG#, please.
In this case, I would advise you to sign out and sign back in from the #PRS_ORG# app by following these steps:
#URL#
You would need your credentials to sign back in.
Also, if you have books that are not from #PRS_ORG#, please have a backup since the process would erase them.
In order to access the account, you would need to use the #PRS_ORG# login option, with your #PRS_ORG# credentials, please.
How is it going?
Are you getting an error message?
Could you go to More sign in options and then select #PRS_ORG#, please?
And are you able to access in the #PRS_ORG# portal with those credentials?
Please check if you can access on the #PRS_ORG# portal.
I couldn't fully understand your last message.
Could you rephrase it, please?
I couldn't fully understand your last message.
Could you rephrase it, please?
I see.
In this case, we have two options:
Yo can create a new account so I can transfer the audiobooks.
Or we could escalate the case to generate a #PRS_ORG# login option so that you don't have to use #PRS_ORG#.
The fastest option is to create a new account.
Once you create it, you can let me know so I can transfer the audiobooks.
Yes, on #URL# please.
How is it going?
Yes, please try another e-mail address.
How is it going?
Great news!
What is the e-mail address for the new account?
Thank you.
Just to confirm, have you made any purchase from that account?
Thank you.
I just processed the library merge.
You would just need to sync to see the audiobooks, please.
Do you see the audiobooks correctly?
You're welcome.
I'm glad we could solve it.
At the moment, is there anything else I can help you with?
Thank you very much, and you're welcome!
I'm glad I could help.
For now, that would be all from my side.

can you please check the ereader model name
so i can provide you the corresponding troubleshooting
there is no #PRS_ORG#
please check on your settings
ok thank you
how do you borrow ebooks?
do you get a message error?
have you tried the #PRS_ORG# buitl in feature on the ereader?
under settings
ok an then?
it is not available?
contact your library and ask them which service they use to borrow ebooks
your other option is to try with #PRS_ORG#
with 3.0 version
Note that if you have installed the version #PRS_ORG#, this may be the source of the problem.
Unfortunately, #PRS_ORG# malfunctions with certain books which are in #PRS_ORG# format at the time of transfer to the reader.
#PRS_ORG# very slightly changes the #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#), and this change is not recognized by #PRS_ORG#.
The #PRS_ORG# format is a widely used standard, but #PRS_ORG# seems to only be able to process books in the #PRS_ORG# format.
This is why with #PRS_ORG# some books are transferable and others are not.
#PRS_ORG# is a third party app (from #PRS_ORG# not #PRS_ORG#) however we can recommend afew steps to try to correct this as advised by the source (#PRS_ORG#)
First, reset the authorization on your #PRS_ORG#
Make sure the date and time settings on your #PRS_ORG# eReader are correct.
You should find these in the Settings menu on your #PRS_ORG#.
Plug your #PRS_ORG# into your computer (using the USB cable that came with your #PRS_ORG#).
Open #PRS_ORG# on your computer.
Use #PRS_ORG# to delete the eBook that's causing issues from your #PRS_ORG# and your computer (make sure to choose the Remove from Library option).
Click on your #PRS_ORG# under the "Devices" menu on the left.
Click device options gear icon next to "Devices," then select Erase Device Authorization.
Click Erase Authorization, then OK to confirm.
Try to reset the authorization in #PRS_ORG#
In #PRS_ORG#, press Ctrl + Shift + D (Command + Shift + D on a #PRS_ORG#) on your keyboard.
In the pop-up window that opens, enter the password for your #PRS_ORG# ID or #PRS_ORG# account (and make sure the correct #PRS_ORG# ID is listed in the drop-down menu).
Then, click Continue.
Select Erase Authorization, then OK.
Authorize your computer again by going to Help > Authorize Computer.
Note: Make sure to reauthorize your computer using the same #PRS_ORG# ID as before.
Otherwise, you won't be able to re-download your eBook
Try transferring the eBook again
Re-download the eBook that was causing issues
Transfer the eBook from #PRS_ORG# to your #PRS_ORG#.
This step will also reauthorize your #PRS_ORG#.
Try opening the title on your #PRS_ORG#.
Hello!
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Can you please help me with the software version of your #PRS_ORG#?

2)Tap the More icon at the bottom right of the screen.
3)Tap Settings.

Would you like for me to send you the steps?
I can also send you the steps via email as well if you prefer trying later?

Some eBooks might not be compatible with the eReader.
Oh, so do you were able to transfer eBooks from another source using #PRS_ORG# with no problems?

Don't worry, everything is completely fine with your Gift Card.
When you redeem a #PRS_ORG# Gift Card in our website to make a purchase, the remaining balance for the card is saved on your #PRS_ORG# account as Store Credit, that is why you cannot use the Gift Card anymore if you try to use it again.
At this moment, you have 44,01 € as Store Credit for your account and this amount of money will be reflected on the checkout of your next purchase if you wish to use it.
As well, if you go to our website at #URL# and sign into your #PRS_ORG# account, you can go to My Account>Account Settings>Payment information.
From that page, you can see the amount of Store Credit that is saved on your account.
No problem, it would be exactly the same.
When you select the eBook you wish to purchase, you will go to the checkout of your purchase before completing it.
From there, the Store Credit should be reflected and you can select it as payment method for your purchase.
Once you select it and  you make sure everything is fine, you can complete your purchase and the Store Credit will be used.
Thank you very much.

What is exactly happening when you try to use the #PRS_ORG# App in your computer?
In what part are you having problems?
Thank you very much.
It is like you open the App and sign in, but after that the App keeps loading?
Can you see a notification informing the App is syncing?
Thank you very much.
In the Desktop App, can you see an option in the top-right corner that looks like a profile icon?
if you click it, you should be able to see the email address associated with the account you are using in the #PRS_ORG# App.
The email address showing there is exactly the same you provided me?
Thank you very much.
I am so sorry to know about it.
By any chance, have you tried to re-install the Desktop App?
In that way, if there is any problem in that part, this could fix it.
Sure, thank you!
Although, in case you have not tried yet, if  you uninstall the App, please check if you can delete any folder that could be related to the Desktop App from your computer.
Once this is done, please download the Desktop App from this link:
Oh, please don't download the App from the #PRS_ORG#, actually that might be the problem.
I believe the #PRS_ORG# has an old version of the Desktop App, which has not been removed from their store for some unknown reason, but that version of the App uses a characteristic blue color instead of the read one.
Make sure the App is downloaded directly from the website.
As for the link, if possible, please try to open it in a different internet browser if it is not working.
As well, just in case, please verify if your internet connection is working with no problems.
Sometimes that could cause some loading problems.
If that link still does not work, please try to use this one:
Thank you very much.
It is strange to know the links are not working.
What internet browser are you using to navigate through the internet?
Thank you very much.
By any chance, if you type "#URL#" in #PRS_ORG#, can you find our website in that way?
Thank you very much.
And if you try to search any other website in #PRS_ORG#, can you see if it is loading or the same problem occurs?
Thank you very much.
By any chance, can you help me providing me a screenshot of the page you can see when you try to open our website using one of the links I sent you, please?
Thank you for the information provided, I hope you are doing fine.
Please let me verify your #PRS_ORG# account.
I will be happy to assist you.
Please give me a moment.
Don't worry, please allow me a moment I have some system issues please be patient.
Thank you for your patience, I'm sorry you have issues with your account.
Do you mean you can't sign in to your account ?

Yuou can't read in landscape mode anymore, correct?
I understand, I apologize for the inconvenience, but I'm going ot help you.
One question.
How did you use the landscape mode on your #PRS_ORG# before?
I see, it's important to share with you, that #PRS_ORG# does not have the landscape mode active from our side.
We are not sure if there's a way to add it to it's functions, byt the device does not have it originally.
I understand.
How were you able to read in lanscape mode before?
I see, we can't assure you how these users were using the landscape mode, since the device does not have this mode active.
Only #PRS_ORG# and #PRS_ORG# have the landscape mode included.
I understand, this feature does not come from us,
for this reason, we can't assure you how it will works on the device.
I apologize, but this feature has never been included on the device.
For this reason landscape mode has not been added after the last update.
We just have 2 devices that include landscape mode, #PRS_ORG# and #PRS_ORG#.
#PRS_ORG# has never include landscape mode, not even before the last update.
We apologize for the misunderstanding.
Is there anything else that I can help you with?
Please let us know if you need further support or if you have any additional questions.
Unfortunately, due to quality purposes, I will need to release the interaction if I don’t receive a response in the next 2 minutes.

You want to use a new #PRS_ORG# account on your eReaders, correct?
So you'd like to be using both accounts but independently at the same time, correct?
And would you like to get all of these books that are located in the old account?
I see, thank you very much.
May I know the name of a book that can be found in the library of this old account, please?
I understand.
You'd like to have the library in both accounts, correct?
Thank you very much,
In this case, we can merge the libraries from one account to another,
the thing is that they'll be rmeoved from the previus one.
It's not possible to keep the same library on two different accounts, I'm really sorry for this.
In this case, this is the way you can get the books back to you, removing them from the other account.
It's true, and I completely understand, believe me.
But we don't have a current process to have the same library under different accounts.
I understand you.
I'm really sorry.

Is that correct?
What message are you seeing in your #PRS_ORG# e reader?

Your e reader should be able to connect to WiFi after you disconnect from your computer.

I have reviewed your details
you have 2 active accounts
1 account with each email address
in this case you can link both accounts
One is #PRS_ORG# and the other one is #PRS_ORG#:
if you don't want to use #PRS_ORG# then you need to deactivate this account
because it is already set with #PRS_ORG#
We can delete this profile so you can create a new account using #PRS_ORG# as login option and not #PRS_ORG#
however, this will take a few days
or you can link the current accounts
with the #PRS_ORG# login option
and then just use #PRS_ORG#
you don't need to use #PRS_ORG#
so we can delete the profile, i will submit your request
your reference number is #NAME#
you will receive a notification via email
just reply to that email and we will proceed to delete your #PRS_ORG# account from #PRS_ORG#
so you can create  a new account using the same email address but without #PRS_ORG#
is this okay for you?

please reply to that email and we will delete the profile with #PRS_ORG#

Thank you for letting me know
You mentioned that you have a new computer, are you using the same #PRS_ORG# ID?
i understand, and the email that you used on the Reader is the same address than you are using on #PRS_ORG#?
Great, so you were able to transfer some books already
I understand.
There's a process we can try
One moment, please
Here is it:
Launch #PRS_ORG#.
Delete the file from #PRS_ORG# as well as from #PRS_ORG# (under My Documents).
Can't you just access to the website and download it again?
I understand.
The next steps would be:
Deauthorize your computer:
Press CTRL+SHIFT+D all at the same time.
(If you're on a Mac, press Command+Shift+D).
Enter your #PRS_ORG# password.
Click Continue.
Click Erase Authorization.
Please take your time
Perfect, now please try this:
Deauthorize your eReader.

Click Erase Device Authorization.
Click Erase Authorization.

Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Nice to meet you, #NAME#.
I hope you are having a great day!
Please, allow me a few minutes to find your account.
Thank you for your patience!
I was able to find and verify your account.
Do you remember the title of the eBook that is not downloading in your #PRS_ORG# App?
Thank you so much, #NAME#.
If you access to your Desktop App, what happens when you try to sync the App?
Thank you very much.
If that is the case, if you click "Settings" in the App, can you see an option that says "Repair your account"?
Thank you very much.
That could also be a possibility.
If you click the profile icon in the Desktop App, what is the email address that you can see there?
Thank you very much, #NAME#.
It seems the second email address is already linked with your #PRS_ORG# account, so both emails are related to the same account.
In the Desktop App, have you tried to sign out and in from your account?
That could update the information of your account in the App to fix the problem.
Sure, no problem!
To sign out of your account, you can also click the profile icon and select this option.
After that, the Desktop App will reload and you will see an option that says "Sign in".
You need to select that option and then enter your email address and password to sign in.
Oh, don't worry!
Actually it seems both accounts were linked already, so this means all your eBooks should be in the same place.
I can see that you have #NUMBER# #PRS_ORG# eBooks saved in your account.
Only the eBooks from a third-party source are not saved in your account, so if you used to have any of these eBooks in a #PRS_ORG#, I'm afraid it is not possible to save them in your #PRS_ORG# account.
Well, what you can actually do is sign out of your account in the eReader and then set up the eReader again using the Desktop App.
In that way, your eReader will have the account updated with the 2 email addresses and all the #PRS_ORG# eBooks.
Do you know what #PRS_ORG# model you have?
Thank you very much.
Yes, in that case, you can try to do this with no problems.
At this moment, did you already tried to sign out and in from your account in the Desktop App?
Perfect!
What can you see in the Desktop App at this moment?
Good to know, thank you!
Once the sync is complete, please let me know if you can see all your #PRS_ORG# eBooks, including the one that was not appearing at first.
Thank you!
Hello #NAME#!
How is everything going?
Thank you very much.
Do you mean the syncing of the Desktop App is still in process?
What can you see about that?
That is fantastic!
I am so happy to know everything is fine with your eBooks now.
I wish you enjoy your reading!
And you're welcome, it is a pleasure to help you.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Perfect!

I wish you have a good day, too!

this error message comes up because Either the computer or the device is not authorized with an #PRS_ORG# ID, or both machines are authorized with different #PRS_ORG# IDs.
In this case you must Deauthorize and then reauthorize #PRS_ORG# on the computer.
Connect the eReader to the computer and authorized again.
If the book has already been downloaded it needs to be deleted (from #PRS_ORG# and the eReader) and then re-downloaded (because the #PRS_ORG# ID authentication is applied at the point of download).
and try to transfer the book again
you need to delete the affected book
and download it from the original source again
Alright, in this case you must contact the book provider in order to reset the #PRS_ORG# license of the book, that should solve the issue
yes but it can be solved with a license reset if the previous steps are not working
unfortunately #NAME# is a third party and we don't have much information about that but we have some trouble shootings steps that you have already tried, those are deauthorizing, reauthorizing, uninstalling and reinstalling, deleting the affected book and download it again
if that does not work you can try with a different version of #PRS_ORG#, if that does not work you can request a #PRS_ORG# license reset
if that does not work, there are no further assistance we can provide, you can try a factory reset on the ereader to clear any data error on the system
unfortunately the ereader only works with the latest software version
i suggest to deauthorize and uninstall #PRS_ORG# and try with another computer if possible
but you need to deauthorize the current computer
For your information, I will be sending you a transcript of our conversation.
Should you have any further questions or concerns, you can always reply back to that email and we will be able to assist you further.
Thank you for contacting #PRS_ORG#, can you please provide the email address of your #PRS_ORG# account?
For security purposes, can you please confirm either the date of your most recent purchase or the title of one of the ebooks/audiobooks in your account?
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Nice to meet you, #NAME#.
I hope you are having a great day!
Please, allow me a few minutes to find your account.
Thank you for your patience!
I was able to find your account.
I am sorry to know you are having problems signing into your account.
On the #PRS_ORG#, when you are on the sign in page, which option did you select when you arrived there?
Thank you very much for the information.
So when you selected the option on the sign in page that says "Continue with #PRS_ORG#", you entered the email address and password associated with your #PRS_ORG# account and still could not sign into your account?
Thank you very much.
At this moment, if you go to the #PRS_ORG# website, can you sign into your account using the same email address and password?
Thank you very much.
By any chance, due to the message you received informed the information was not correct, could be possible that maybe the email address or the password were entered with a typing mistake?
Sometimes, if this information is not entered exactly as it was set before, it will not be possible to access your account until the information is correct.
Thank you very much.
And for the second email address, are you entering the new password you set for the new account?
I ask because if maybe you tried to enter the password of the same account and it is not the same, that could also cause the problem.
Thank you very much.
On the eReader, what happens if you go back to the main sign in page?
What can you see there?
Well, in this case, because you only have #PRS_ORG# as login option, you should need to click the option to login with #PRS_ORG#, so please try to select it again and enter your information one more time to see if maybe you can sign in this time with your #PRS_ORG# credentials.
Sure, thank you so much!
Fantastic!
I am happy to know you have access to your account now.
As for your question, now that you have your account, you could begin to purchase eBooks from the #PRS_ORG# store on the eReader, or maybe from our website at #URL#.
In this case, if you want to try with some free eBooks, you can go to our #PRS_ORG# website using this link:
When you access to this link, please search for an option that says "Sign in" or " Log In".
It should be on the top-right corner of the website.
Not exactly, if you have the eReader connected to the WiFi at the moment, it is not necessary to connect it to the computer to transfer #PRS_ORG# eBooks.
If you want to add a free eBooks from to your #PRS_ORG# account, you need to access the link I sent you, sign into your account using #PRS_ORG# as login option and then you can add all the free eBooks you want to your account.
Once you add all the eBooks, you can go back to the eReader and then sync the eReader to download the new eBooks there.
To sync, there is an icon on the top that looks like a spinning arrow or circle.
Only if you would like to try transfer eBooks from a third-party device, it would be necessary to use a computer and another program called #PRS_ORG# to make that transfer process.
You're welcome, #NAME#!
It is a pleasure to help you.
I wish you enjoy your reading and if you require further assistance with it, please let us know at anytime you need and we will be more than happy to help you!
Is there anything else I can do for you?
For security purposes, can you please confirm either the date of your most recent purchase or the title of one of the ebooks/audiobooks in your account?
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Nice to meet you!
I hope you are having a great day!
Please, allow me a few minutes to find your accounts.
Thank you for your patience!
I was able to find the 2 accounts.
Just to verify both accounts, can you provide me your postal code, please?
Thank you for the verification!
Now that both accounts are verified, I could proceed to transfer the eBooks from one account to another one.
In that way, all the eBooks will be saved in on specific account and that is the account you will need to use from now on.
Which of these 2 accounts would you like to keep as the main account?
Thank you so much!
in that case, I will transfer the eBooks to that #PRS_ORG# account and that is the one you will need to use to read and purchase so all your #PRS_ORG# content can be saved in the same place.
Everyone is using this account in their #PRS_ORG# Apps, or eReaders, at the moment?
Oh, I see!
In that case, I will merge the eBooks to the delplace account so they can download after this.
Same as before, you would need to use that account from now on to read and purchase.
Is that okay for you?
Perfect!
Please, just allow me a moment to transfer the eBooks.
Thank you for your patience!
The eBooks have been successfully transferred to the account you wanted.
If you and your girls sync their #PRS_ORG# devices while using this account, they should be able to see the new eBooks download.
10 eBooks were transferred, so the account they are using now has #NUMBER# #PRS_ORG# eBooks saved.
You're welcome!
It is a pleasure to help you.
I wish you and your daughter's enjoy the reading!
Thank you for your time and kindness!
Have a lovely evening, too!

I will be happy to assist you.
Please give me a moment.
I'm sorry you have issues with the ebook you purchased.
What is the title of the ebook you have issues with?
What kind of device are you using to read the ebooks?
Ok.
Thank you.
Please click repair account on the #PRS_ORG# app.
Don't worry, I have worked with the ebook now here.
Please try to click repair account on the after I worked the ebook from here.
I understand.
Have you repair account on the iphone?
#PRS_ORG# app
Were you able to open the ebook?
Please sign out from the #PRS_ORG# account on the #PRS_ORG# app then wait 3 minutes and sign back in again.
I'm trying to help you and I would like you to please follow my instructions, because I just worked with the ebook here.
No don't remove the ap[p
Just sign out from the #PRS_ORG# account.
Ok. thanks
Ok. One moment please
I didn't find the ebook:  City of paper in your #PRS_ORG# account or purchased history.
When was it purchased?
Do you have the receipt# ?
Ok.
Thanks
Ok.
It must be in your email
Ok.
If you have or use another email that may be related to the #PRS_ORG# account; you can also provide me that so I can search for an account
The last purchased was the MAggie now ebook and this is  from #NUMBER#, I don't see any purchased from 2020
So I think you may have use a different email address and created a different account and this is the reason the ebook  is not under this account.
At the moment the phone support is not available but I can help you here.
Please provide me  a screenshot of your payment that you made for that ebook.
I'm sorry at the moment our phone support is temporary unavailable but I will be happy to help you on the chat or email support.
You can also provide a screenshot of your  bank statement
I'm sorry I don't understand what was your method of payment
If  you saw the ebook the confirmation email must be in your recycle bin.

Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Nice to meet you, #NAME#.
I hope you are having a great day!
Please, allow me a few minutes to find your account.
Thank you for your patience and the information!
I was able to find an account but it seems the information is not matching.
In order to verify it, can you provide me your postal code, please?
Thank you for the verification!
All the eBooks you cannot find at the moment were purchased with #PRS_ORG#?
Thank you so much.
I am sorry to know you cannot find them.
If that is the case, I believe they must be saved in a different #PRS_ORG# account associated with a different email address, so we just need to find that account first to locate the eBooks.
The account I just found at the moment seems to be created very recently and has not been used at all.
Do you have any other email address that you could provide me?
I can try to search for an account under our records using it.
Thank you very much.
I was able to find the other account and I verified it using your postal code.
Indeed, this is the source of the problem.
All your eBooks were purchased in the other account and because the accounts are not related between each other, you can only access to the eBooks you purchase if you are using the account you used to purchase them.
In this case, it seems that you created a different #PRS_ORG# account instead using the other one, and because this account has no eBooks yet, you cannot see your eBooks because it is not the account you used to purchase them.
Do you sill have access to the email address associated with the original account?
Yes, that is correct!
You would need to use that account in order to access all your #PRS_ORG# eBooks.
Is it possible for you to access the account?
Well, you would need to access the original account in both devices to begin using your eBooks, but if you wish to try and see if you can sign in first, you can try to sign in in our website at #URL#
In that way, if you do have access to the account, we can sign into that account in your eReader.
Great, thank you!
What can you see there at the moment?
Can you see an option to sign in?
Thank you.
Indeed, that is why you cannot see the eBooks at the moment, you would need to sign out of that account in the eReader and then sign into the original.
Do you know what #PRS_ORG# model you have?
Thank you so much!
Before you sign out of that account in the eReader, do you still remember the password associated with the original account to sign in?
If that is the case, it is not necessary to provide me the password.
Thank you.
Yes, if you go to #URL# and you have the other account, you also need to sign out and then sign into the original account.
At this moment, are you setting up the #PRS_ORG# eReader again?
The original account is the one associated with the second email address you provided me.
Yes, it is completely possible!
If you have a second eReader, you also need to sign in on the original account and all your #PRS_ORG# will also download in the second eReader.
Great!
Thank you.
Please, let me know if you have success signing in.
Thank you for letting me know.
I am sorry to know about it.
Which login option did you selected to sign in?
Do you mean you are trying to connect the eReader to the WiFi at this moment?
The WiFI is properly connected to the eReader at the moment?
Thank you very much.
Do you had success signing in with the #PRS_ORG# login option?
Good to know!
That login option is also associated with your account, so that explains why it worked!
And yes, as long as you always use the original account in all your devices with #PRS_ORG#, your eBooks will download there.
I wish you enjoy your reading!
And you're welcome, it is a pleasure to help you!
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Thank you so much!
I wish you also have a good end of the day, too!
Thank you for your time and kindness, #NAME#.
Anytime you need, I am so glad to know about this.
It means so much for me to know I was able to help you both with this!
Goodbye!
Hello!
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you
So.. you want to use this two email addresses in one account?
would you like to unify these two accounts?
what count would you like to keep using?
if you unify your accounts, you can only make use of one
you need to chose which one to keep
sure!
allow me a moment to work in it
I'm still with you, working on it
both accounts are linked to #PRS_ORG#
write down which one you'd like to cancel please
I'm gonna merge acounts
it will always be advisable to use only one account, because having several, your books will split and you won't be able to see them all in one place
I have two email addresses
which one would you like to use?
the other one will be deactivated but first, your ebooks will be transferred to that account.
All ebooks in one account (#PRS_ORG#)
yes
so.. your #PRS_ORG# will be the only account active
thank you
one second
I have to inform you that I'm not succeeding in unifying your accounts, what I can do is give you a guide to how to unlink your accounts
you can try it from your PC
No, you won't lose anything
everything belongs to the same account
but you've searched two emails, just unlink the one you don't want to use anymore
that's good
from now on just sign in with your #PRS_ORG# account please
Thank you for contacting #PRS_ORG#, it was my pleasure to assist you today.

After you have updated the billing information under your account you have to sign out from the #PRS_ORG# account on the ereader too and sign back in so that way it will be able to update it.
If this is ok for you please let me know.
Sometimes it doesn't work, I can remove it for you, if you want?
If you add the payment information and automatically  will fix the other issue as I explained on the message.
But please tell me if you want me to remove your billing information
Do you mean that you can sign in to the #PRS_ORG# ereader?
Do you mean that you can sign in to the #PRS_ORG# ereader with your #PRS_ORG# account?
What is the issue on the eReader?
Is it frozen?
What I can see is that your #PRS_ORG# account is linked to the #PRS_ORG# account there for you have to always use #PRS_ORG# as sign in option> enter this email #EMAIL#  and  enter the #PRS_ORG# account password.
Ok.
In that case you have to update the email address with #PRS_ORG#.
When you update the #PRS_ORG# account this is automatically is update it with the #PRS_ORG# sign in option.
Please contact to #PRS_ORG# and ask them to update the email if you don't want to use the same email address.
I'm sorry I don't understand
What email address do you use with #PRS_ORG#?
I understand, what I suggest is to contact to #PRS_ORG# and ask them to delete #EMAIL# this email from #PRS_ORG# account because this is the one shows and you connect in #PRS_ORG#.
All deleted

thank you very much, If I understand correctly, the screen of the ereader is frozen?
was your device updated before this problem?

is it possible to turn off the ereader?
can you please let me know the model of your #PRS_ORG# ereader?
it is a #PRS_ORG#
thank you
in this case we can try a manual reset
this will remove the information on your ereader
but all your #PRS_ORG# books can be recovered with a sync
we suggest to backup books from different sources than #PRS_ORG#
Please try the following on your eReader:
did you charge the eReader?
so the restoration screen is not showing up when pressing and holding the button for several seconds?
Okay, this procedure is the last step we can try to solve this kind of issue, please let me know when and where was your device purchased, I can review your warranty options
i continue with you
are you still online?
is it older than 2 years?
As I mentioned before, the manual reset is the last procedure we can try at the moment, please let me contact my team to check what other options we have for you
I have contacted my team, however, your device is no longer under warranty, in this case we recommend to try multiple resets on the ereader, that could solve the issue, as a  goodwill gesture we will provide a discount for you in order to purchase a new #PRS_ORG# device, i will send this information via email, if you want to receive the discount just reply to the email
are you still online?

Hello, I just bought a #PRS_ORG# reader and I only have access to English books and prices in dollars, even though I'm in France.
#EMAIL#
I haven't used or bought an e book yet because I received it as a Christmas gift.
I cannot order, prices are in dollars.
What should I do?
Can I do this from my smartphone?
I need to connect to my computer then?
Or my reader?
Ok thank you.
Also, when I search for a title on the #PRS_ORG# website, it can't be found.
Ex: Thousand white women
Because of the billing info?
Right now, I can't find a single title!
Another example "LA PANTHERE DES NEIGE", can't be found in the story.
Ok I'm going to follow your advice and I'll see.
Thank you.

Hello.
I'm contacting you about a problem I have with an ebook.
This is the ebook "Alice in #PRS_ORG#."
In this one, a page was missing.
After contacting the publisher of this book, he told me that the problem had been solved and that by re-downloading the ebook there would be the changes.
But that is not the case.
#EMAIL#
#NAME# - #ALPHANUMERIC_ID#
Absolutely.
I use the #PRS_ORG# app on my tablet or #PRS_ORG# software on my PC
ok
I will disconnect
It is done.
ok I'll take a look
The book opens on the #PRS_ORG# app as well as via #PRS_ORG# but I still have the same problem: Pages 56 and 57 are duplicated so I miss a page.
However, the publisher confirmed to me that he had changed it.
I have the same problem whether the file is downloaded via the #PRS_ORG# application or with the #PRS_ORG# application.
I'd prefer you to report it thank you.
Ok.
Thank you.
No that's all thanks.
Good day to you too.

I've been trying to buy a book with my reader since yesterday. I even tried with my mobile on #PRS_ORG# and I always get the same message when I try to pay for it: "Postal/zip code must be 9 characters or less.please use a valid length to continue."

Why did this problem happen?
I hadn't changed anything since the last time.
On the other hand, with the billing address - which is still the same - I noticed that the city was on the left and the zip code on the right.
Was it this change on the #PRS_ORG# site that blocked my purchase?

In my #PRS_ORG# account to borrow books from the library or buy them, I am only offered books in English and I want books in French.
Thank you.
Are you there?
Oh okay.
Yes I think so, but I can't see the information.

Yes only the #PRS_ORG# books appear in English,
I'm in #PRS_ORG#, I see books in English but not the settings.
Ok in the settings I see libraries of Montreal and it's French in Montreal.
Yes,
I did so a few months ago.
How can I see that?
Where?
On my e-reader?
I'm really disappointed #PRS_ORG# seems to only have books in English, I bought this e-reader to also download books directly from the library.
Can you explain how to do it?
Thank you.
Thank you and have a good day.

Hello,
I have a recurring problem with downloading books from the library on my e-reader.
In fact, when I download and drag them into the file of my reader, after opening my reader, I see the downloaded file but it is black and I cannot open it.

Of course!

Ok I'll do that.
There, it's done, but unfortunately

So what do I do?
It says that it can be read on the #PRS_ORG# app
Ok, I'll wait.
Thank you
Yes, but if I use the zoom feature I can't fix the page, it's too large or too small and it goes either to the right or to the left.
Thank you, it's surprising that I can't see the police icon.
How do I remove it and eventually download it again with no extra costs?
Simply remove it from my library and then download it again it to see if the issue persists or is fixed.
If possible, I would like to return it to buy the hardcopy version.
It must be an issue with the manufacturing of the e-book, since the previous one works normally
I just reset it and I can't turn it off.
I have to press it for a very long time and repeat it several times, and when I succeed the book picture remains displayed although it's turned off

I've already done that and nothing has changed.
Is it normal that the screen remains on when it's turned off

Why?
That wastes battery
I would also like to know why do I have to press the button for such a long time in order to turn it on
Ok, just a moment
Will this affect my reading
If I set 15 minutes, will it turn off after 15 minutes of reading??
Oh, ok.
Thank you.
If I still have freezing problems, should I return it to the store??
Yes.
I try to turn it off, but it won't.
I keep pressing the button, but nothing happens.

Thank you for everything and have a good evening

Please help.

Thank you

It's asking me sign in on the #PRS_ORG#

so my account was taken
It worked, I have the book.

Hello, I just received my e-reader #PRS_ORG#.
I have two books in Spanish there and the Spanish or Spanish-English dictionary doesn't work.
#EMAIL#
Today.
En torno al casticismo by #NAME#
yes
try what?
hello again, it didn't work
none of the two steps
yes, I did that
I select only one word
but it doesn't find it
I tried several words.
An easy word like 'mañana', for instance
and I added the Spanish-English dictionary
yes
but no word
every word I click on, I get the message 'no definition found'
no, because I'm reading a book in Spanish
I have two books in Spanish, and I'm having the same issue with both
I'm not sure I understand your question...
I tap on a word and a window pops up, which directs me to the dictionary I installed, but it doesn't work
it still doesn't work

So what should I do?

I did that before contacting you
Should I do it again?
I signed out
Yes
Should I sign in again?
Yes
Ok, I'll go there
And then I sign in?
Yes
I must have closed it by mistake
But I'm back
It worked, my book just showed up, thanks 🙏
I'm really happy 😊
No, thank you very much for your time and patience
Happy new year #NUMBER#
I created a #PRS_ORG# account, which says that this account already exists and rejects my password even if I change it.
I don't want to create an account with another email, so what should I do?
PS I forgot that I created a #PRS_ORG# account on my Ipad a long time ago
#EMAIL#
Welcome to Place Beauvau
It was free
I don't have many more details; it's been a long time since I had it on my ipad
#PRS_ORG# opened, so it seems to be working.
I'm on my PC.
Now I'll have to see if it works on my e-reader!
thank you very much for your help.
you too.
Wishing you best with your work on public holidays!
hello, I bought the number mentioned on my e-reader from the #URL# site.
But I have to link this #PRS_ORG# account via #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG#: could you please tell me which address I have to enter for #PRS_ORG# by #PRS_ORG#?
that's what I did, but it's being rejected.
I'll try it again
it worked, what should I do now so that the eBooks on my #PRS_ORG# show on my e-reader (#PRS_ORG#)?
I synced it on my e-reader, but I don't see the 2 eBooks that are on my dropbox
I did the whole thing until step 6, then what account is that?
I did all the settings again
login to #PRS_ORG# rejected: it says that this email address is already being used!!!
e-reader / #PRS_ORG# loading and so on.
It's telling me to wait
this is nerve-wrecking!
right now the e-reader is blocked, it's loading.
In fact, I'm on a #PRS_ORG# page, under the title it says: Last update/August 24, 2020.
I just bought my #PRS_ORG# e-reader...
and there you go, it sends me back to Log in with #PRS_ORG#
So I'll enter my email and password
account not found: I'll click on forgotten password
it works: your opinion, please?
#PRS_ORG# is asking me if I agree to share my personal information with #PRS_ORG#?
thank you! well, it didn't work, the books were not transferred from #PRS_ORG# to my e-reader.
Only one came from #PRS_ORG#.
The others certainly come
You were very helpful, I'm not going to bother you any more, but I thought it would be possible to add eBooks to the #PRS_ORG# e-reader whatever their origin.
I will be very disappointing if it isn't.
I will read the technical info and maybe contact #PRS_ORG# for clarification.
Thank you very much and have a good evening.
I bought some ebooks and I can't read them because I can't open the file

Hello!
I borrowed two books from the municipal library, as I often do.
When I try to read them on my e-reader, I get a message saying "Your reader does not have permission to open this book.
This book is protected by #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#).
Since you deauthorized your e-reader previously, you must re-import it by using #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#). "
I can see and open the book on my computer via the e-reader peripheral, but I can't read it on the device.
What should I do?
My linked account is #NAME#
I haven't bought a book recently and I don't think I ever did...
Ok, I'll try it.
Thank you!
Are you still there?
It still doesn't work.
Is there any another solution?
Why am I not getting any reply?
Hello!
I followed the steps, but they did not solve the problem, unfortunately.
That's what I did as well.
The problem persists.
So I have to return them and borrow them again?
Unfortunately, it doesn't work.
However, I am able to open the books in the biblioroom on the computer and on the device.
It just does not work when I disconnect my e-Reader.
ok
Will I receive the instructions on the chat or by email?
#PRS_ORG#
Do you need the model number?
#PRS_ORG#
Is it normal that I have not received anything yet?
Ok, thank you for your help!
Hoping it works!
Do I have to leave the conversation myself?

What is a third-party book?

Could you explain to me how I retrieve a book I just bought on a site other than #PRS_ORG#

Good weekend
Hello,
I bought the ebook Ascendance of a bookworm Part 3 Volume 3.
After downloading it to my eReader (via the #PRS_ORG# app), all I get is a preview, not the full book.
I tried removing it and downloading it again, but I always get the same result.
How do I download the correct book?
Thank you
#EMAIL#
It should be noted that I make the purchases via #PRS_ORG#
This was on January 4
It's a #PRS_ORG# eReader
#PRS_ORG# if I remember correctly
yes, that's right
Is it on the eReader menu?
I don't see that option.
OR do I have to do it with the #PRS_ORG# app on my PC?
Oh yes, I see it on the app, I'm launching it
Done.
Yes, thank you, I had not checked the device information, but the account section
But nothing changed regarding the book, do I have to remove it and download it again?
Done
I signed out from the app and the eReader, waited for 3 minutes, and signed in on the app again
I use the app to retrieve the books on the eReader because I'm having wifi connection issues
The app has just finished resyncing, but nothing has changed regarding the book
It's there, but it's still a preview and not the full book, nothing has changed
After singing in again, I didn't do anything with this particular ebook, but the app seems to have downloaded at least some of them on its own
Should I remove it and download it again?
Sorry, I started before I saw your message
The ebook is here again, I'll wait for your message before doing anything
I'm offline
Syncing is over, still the same issue
The book is incomplete, it's only an excerpt and not the full book
the ebook opens (and it has always opened), but the content is not the full book
on the app
but on Monday I retrieved it on the eReader and it was the same
No, I didn't connect it while we were doing these actions
I can connect it, but if the book does not show correctly in the app, I guess it will be the same on the eReader
The table of contents is only the Cover and the Preview, and it's only 25 pages
uninstalled, reinstalled, no change
I don't think the installation is the problem here, the comments on the book at the store show that I'm not the only one facing this problem
No change
Ok, I tried to contact them first, but I didn't succeed
Yes, it makes sense
Thanks anyway, have a nice day
I bought the eBook "Fire Force Volume 12."

I started reading them at that time!

NO, I followed your various steps.
I'll see if this has changed anything.
My battery is at 15%, I hope we won't be disconnected!
Still the same!
I recorded some with a #PRS_ORG#.

thank you

Maybe it's 2 extracts and I can't find an invoice.
I went back to #NUMBER#.
No, it would say extract and not NON #PRS_ORG#!
Can you see it with #EMAIL#?
Damn!
Can't you re-upload them for me?

The On/Off button my new e-reader does not work.

Thank you
#NAME#
I used #EMAIL# by logging in with my #PRS_ORG# account
The problem is this: I can't turn off the e-reader and the sleep/out of sleep function doesn't always work
it was purchased from c-discount, which directed me to your customer service
no, it's an online store

Understood, thanks for your help.
Have a great day as well, thank you.
I have a #PRS_ORG# and I no longer have the PIN to unlock the eReader, and the #PRS_ORG# site does not provide a correct solution to replace the PIN
#EMAIL#
I haven't used it for a long time and my daughter would like to use it
#ALPHANUMERIC_ID#, a gift from the company #PRS_ORG# when my daughter-in-law was working there
The home screen is locked and requires a PIN to provide access to the eReader.
I can't do anything without this PIN and I would like to completely reset the eReader
The eReader's home screen is locked
I don't understand, because the USB cable is the cable that is connected to the wall but cannot be connected to my computer!
The eReader doesn't allow two connections!
But the screen is still locked and I can't do anything without resetting the PIN.
How can I reset it without the PIN?
Please provide the exact steps so that I can try to restore the factory settings!
Are we connected?!
I did this step, but the restoration screen does not appear!
Hello,
I bought a #PRS_ORG# reader on December 24.
I noticed a problem the first time I used it, the screen tends to "jump", that is, to become black for a moment and then get back to normal.
It does this when I change the page or when I'm in the menu.
I went to see the seller, who confirmed the problem, but the after-sales service procedure directed me to you.
What should I do?
#EMAIL#
Yes, every time I go there, the screen turns black for a few seconds then becomes normal again.
I saw it with the after-sales service and with the seller, who told me that this is not normal
The #PRS_ORG#, CDiscount section
Yes, I took everything, I know the procedure because I also work there.
The after-sales service procedure says I should contact the supplier directly, and it was the last one on stock.
Okay
There is the sync symbol and it's loading
As soon as it turned on and the language choice was shown, it restarted
Every time I do something, the screen turns black for a few moments
#ADDRESS#; #PHONENUMBER#; #PRS_ORG#!
Is it possible to get a refund from my store?
Ok, but for a refund the store needs the agreement of the supplier.
It's just that I'm afraid I'll get another defective product!
So I get a replacement and send you this one?
Can you send me a return label?
And I'll send it to you as soon as I get the other one?
No, thank you
Thank you very much, have a nice day

Ok, thank you
But I'm unable to link it with the #PRS_ORG# account

I don't understand?
When I log in to #PRS_ORG# via my #PRS_ORG# account, I cannot link a #PRS_ORG# account
but when I'm on the #PRS_ORG# site, I don't see how I can access a #PRS_ORG# account
so it's the same password?
I just tried it on the eReader and I still can't log in with #PRS_ORG#
it says account not found
that's exactly what I did, but the #PRS_ORG# account doesn't work
yes

I never bought a book.
I will explain.
When I download a book from my municipal library, an error message is shown on my e-Reader.
My e-Reader indicates this to me: Your e-Reader is not allowed to open this book.
This book is protected by #PRS_ORG# digital rigth management.
Having previously unauthorized your e-Reader, you must re-import it using #PRS_ORG#.
Yes.
I reset my e-Reader believing that it was going to fix the problem.

I allow both from #PRS_ORG#.
I was already talking to someone, but she left the chat before I asking her my last question
I would like to erase all the books in #PRS_ORG#, but I am not able.
I erase them and when I reopen #PRS_ORG#, they return
I delete via #PRS_ORG# and when I open it, they are always #NAME#
There
I removed the permission on my e-Reader and in #PRS_ORG#.
I have closed my e-Reader and I will open it again.
In fact, it is this stage that I do not know

Delete all files of the eBooks from your computer, even from the trash.
You will need to ask your library to reset the eBook #PRS_ORG# license and request a new copy of the eBook
Do you want me to contact my municipal library?
I tried with another e-Reader and it works
My e-Reader is the problem.
I try with lots of books and no book works.
But, it works with another e-Reader.
I think the problem comes from my e-Reader and not from the license.
it does not work
Your e-Reader is not allowed to open this book
This book is protected by #PRS_ORG# digital rigth management.
Having previously unauthorized your reader, you must re-import it using #PRS_ORG#.
It is really weird because it worked for 2 years and it does not work anymore
I have not changed anything.

can you refer me to someone in Mauricie?
Ok
It is been 4 times that I connect with someone, and my problem persists.
I understand.
I will try again and re-communicate next time.

Since I made an update, I can no longer open books on my eReader.
I'm getting a message that says that the books are protected by #PRS_ORG# digital rights management and that I have to authorize my eReader again with my #PRS_ORG# ID.
I don't understand.
I don't want to get a subscription or create any account, I just want to read my books, so what's the problem here???
#EMAIL#

I haven't bought any books since I got my eReader, I already had my books, which I transferred to the eReader
Hello?
How do I do that?
1- You say open #PRS_ORG#.
Where do I open it?
On my computer?
1- You say you open #PRS_ORG#.
2- You say I should delete the #PRS_ORG# file from my documents: I don't have it on my computer, and even if I had, why would I have to open it and delete it?
3- You say I need to cancel the computer's permission: do I have to connect the reader at the same time?
4-I don't have a #PRS_ORG# account
Why can't I open my books on my eRreader?
I don't want to pay for #PRS_ORG#, I don't need it.
I've been having issues since the update, and I didn't have any issues before that
Is it free?
I can open them on my computer without any problems
I didn't have any problems before the update, I can no longer open the documents, these are PDF documents from school, they are not protected!
Is #NAME# free?
I will try what you suggested now.
If there is a problem, I will contact you again, thank you

If there's a problem, I prefer to get a refund.
Or can you add the credit to her #PRS_ORG# account?
I've purchased #PRS_ORG# gift cards before, why doesn't it work with this account?
No, on #NAME#'s #PRS_ORG# account 
But maybe that's what you're suggesting?
Yes, perfect!
indeed: #EMAIL#
my friend had given me an incorrect address
this is the address of her #PRS_ORG# account, which you can credit
no, you can credit #NAME#'s account, whose right address I've just given you
Thank you, sorry for the confusion
My friend hasn't received the €30 on her account yet
is this normal?
she's checking her account
Okay it worked, thank you.
I'm trying to open the #PRS_ORG# app on #PRS_ORG# and it doesn't work.
#EMAIL#
Where do I find it
Oh dear
That's what you get when you talk to a bot...
To answer your question, it was December 18, #NUMBER#.
The app just keeps loading.
If I right click, I manage to open a menu but my purchase is not there.
I see that the app is trying to load after entering my information, but it remains "empty"
No, I can only see "Log in" and a pattern showing that the app is loading
After some time, the application closes automatically
It's a really terrible app haha
I'll try
I have to choose it from #PRS_ORG#, right?
The link you gave me does not load
White page
None of the links/browsers work
And my wifi is OK, since we are communicating
#PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG#
#PRS_ORG#
Also
No
The other sites are working
Same thing when I click on the links contained in the promotional messages you send
Even when using an InPrivate window
when I go to #URL#, I get a message that reads This page does not work
Le bal des folles
or even if I use another browser
Are you still there?
I'm unable to log into your site (still loading) to buy books.
This problem has been going on for a few weeks now.
/ I'm unable to log into your site to buy books.
#EMAIL# but it happens even before I can log in
As I said, it happens before I can sign into my account, it happens when I try to access your site
No, I mean I cannot access the #URL# site, even before I try to log into my account
it is not a problem with my account, it is a problem accessing your site&lt;
I did that, I tried using a private window, I tried #PRS_ORG# on my phone, and it doesn't work
hello
do you prefer French or English?
French
I tried to log into #URL# using several browsers (#PRS_ORG#, #PRS_ORG#, #PRS_ORG#, InPrivate window)
even before I sign into my account, I can't access your site
which means that I can't buy books
it takes some time before the error message is displayed
but the message says that the page doesn't work #PRS_ORG#
This page does not work #URL# has not sent any data.
ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE
why is this necessary if this happens before I try to log into my account?
yes
yes
I can't disable it and I've accessed it in the past
Hello, I just bought one and I'm very disappointed; unlike the announcement, the #PRS_ORG# does not offer landscape mode view, which is an absolutely essential feature for me.
I read in forums that it disappeared with the latest firmware versions.
#EMAIL#
I unpacked it today and I use epubs with no copyright
Simply, regardless of the #PRS_ORG# book, which is readable, there is no icon to change the orientation, which existed before the last firmware updates.
This is a known problem in #PRS_ORG# forums
That's right
ok
Everything is described above
What is your native language?
I'm telling you that the device used to have it before the updates
Not me, people who used the same device with an older firmware version
Not true.
In fact, I just read that you simply have to add a line to the #PRS_ORG# file to reactivate it: [DeveloperSettings] ForceAllowLandscape=true
Because you forgot to include it in the new firmware
I can see that you won't help me, goodbye
Hello, I'd like to rent a book using my reader on over drive, all the pages have been filled, but I can't recover the book in question
#EMAIL#
I don't want to buy, but to rent it
Hello,
I did it, but I can't get the book back, what should I do?
I'm on over drive and logged into my account, the name of the library network is there, but what do I need to do to get my book?
To borrow it
Well, I am on my #PRS_ORG# settings, I connect through wi-fi
What billing?
The information was already entered in my #PRS_ORG#, what can I do in addition to this?
Ok, but how do I get there?
Sorry, I'm not from the generation who knows how to deal with these things
I click on account and I don't see the account settings
How can I do it?
I'm on the #PRS_ORG# destop
So, I have to go to the 'account' on my laptop and not on the reader
Ok, I clicked on accounts
Now what should I do
I don't see ' my account'
it only says 'back to store' and 'French'
I'm on the site that you indicated
on the #PRS_ORG# desktop app and I clicked on the 'Accounts' green box
well, I'll take your leave, this is too much for me right now, I'll contact you later
My #PRS_ORG# eReader, bought from Cdiscount on March 2020, is no longer working
I think it's #EMAIL#
This eReader was purchased on March 21 #NUMBER# from the Cdiscount website.
part of the screen is frozen
and there are some white vertical lines
it was fully charged
yes, I just logged in
I can't see the top of the screen because it's "frozen," I followed the steps and restored it.
I restarted the reader, but part of the screen is still frozen
no, the product has not suffered any physical damage, it could a hardware problem with the electronic part.
the product is under warranty and covers hardware problems
I'm sorry, but I will not accept that answer.
I believe that these display issues are related to a hardware problem involving an electronic malfunction.
Unfortunately, this is very common with such devices.
Restarting the device, as you have suggested, does not fix this kind of #URL#, please take this problem into account and provide an appropriate answer
I am really sorry, but I am very dissatisfied with your answers.
I bought a product less than a year ago.
In all likelihood there is an electronic problem.
I expect you to repair the reader, nothing else.
My device was working very well last night and was no longer working this morning when I woke up, nobody touched it.
This cannot be a case of device misuse.
I am afraid that you are obliged by the contractual guarantee to take into account my warranty request.
If you are unable to process my request, please provide me with a mailing address where I can send a registered letter.
Have you read my last answer?
I do not wish to leave a comment on your site but to send a registered letter to your service to assert my consumer rights.
Can you provide me this postal address?
Please provide me the postal address, I will send a registered letter and we will see what happens then.
No, nothing else, my 2 other #PRS_ORG# readers work well
For your information, this eReader is new.
I started it the evening before yesterday and it seemed to be working fine.
Last night I wanted to use it again, and that's when I found it was locked.
#PRS_ORG# locked on standby mode
Nothing works, it won't turn on.
It is charged (more than 90%) and I tried to long press the start button (more than 1 minute) and then to long press the page change button and the start button at the same time.
the one requested before the chat, i.e. #EMAIL#
Hello, #NAME#, do you have the information I sent to #NAME#?
Yes
On lethal standby mode, I might add!
The eReader is charged (the message "94% charged" is displayed under the message "On standby").
The cover page of the last book I read is also displayed, with the reading percentage at the bottom of the page.
As before, I tried the two recommended troubleshooting steps (I pressed the button or buttons for more than a minute), but nothing changed, the eReader is still stuck in standby mode.
This is my first experience with a #PRS_ORG# reader (previously I used an Android tablet) and it's a disgrace!
#NAME#
#ADDRESS#
#ADDRESS#
#NUMBER#

Yes, you didn't tell me it was over...
So it's goodbye?
Thank you, that's it for now.
I have an email address on two eReaders, mine and my husband's, whom I've divorced; I bought a new #PRS_ORG# and I had to change the email address so that he won't be able to access the books I buy, so I would like to know if it is possible to transfer books from my old email address, which will remain in the possession of my ex-husband, to my new email address
the new address is #EMAIL#
The old one, which is that of my ex-husband, is #NAME#
I bought the #PRS_ORG# and the most recent book there is dedans il était deux fois by #NAME# 
The other email address must have about #NUMBER# books
Only thrillers
No, just the last #PRS_ORG#, I want to keep the other address so that he can continue using it, but I don't want to log out each time to change the email address and read one of the books we used to have in common
Basically, I would like to have the books from the old email address without deleting the other
Account, so that he can continue using it
Without having access to my new purchases
I would like to retrieve the books that are on the old email address without closing the account
Just a book transfer
Without changing anything on the old email address
Yes, if possible
I would sort out what I've already read
Or just the ones that have been downloaded, because I've already read the others
But I don't know if you have access to all that
It must have about #NUMBER# downloads, if memory serves
Des #NAME# style juste une ombre, the complete #NAME# series with Sharko and Hennebelle
#NAME#
Sir Cedric, which I have not read
However, you really have to keep the books on the other email address so that I won't have any extra problems
Yes, without him having access to my new purchases
So there won't be any connection whatsoever
So I can't read the books...
Or I'll have to buy them again
So, if I decide to change my password, I will no longer have access to anything
Yes, but this will create other problems between the two of us
I really don't know any other way to do this
Well, too bad
You should really raise this issue, because I don't think I'm the only one with this need
Very well, I will contact them regarding this issue, thanks
No, thanks
Hello, this is the 2nd time that this happens to me, I can't download a book that I bought.
Some time ago I bought le parfum du bonheur est plus fort sous la pluie, by Virginie grimaldi, but after several attempts I still can't download it.
#EMAIL#
Today, January 10, #NUMBER#
I don't have a receipt, I had a "voucher" that cost me €30 to buy 3 books.
I also had this problem the first time; sometimes I manage to download it later, but I've been trying for several months
I can't send you a screenshot with this book on my list

Yes, I think so.
Where can I find the receipts, I looked for it in the various tabs but I couldn't find it
If the screenshot is from my library, that's all I have on my phone
Yes, these are my books and le parfum du bonheur est plus fort sous la pluie by #NAME# is there, but I can't download it
Excuse me?
Yes
Yes, I was, I'm downloading it now.
Thank you
No, thank you very much
Have a nice day

I didn't download the book when the payment was made, I got this message: Oops!

Please check your payment information and try again.

NEUF PARFAITS ETRANGERS by #NAME#
I just tried another book and it's the same problem again, I can't pay
and of course, I checked and I can confirm that the credit card is the right one
my samsung tablet, my computer and my #PRS_ORG# eReaders, maybe I should change something in the settings?
as I told you, it gets blocked when it's time to pay, it shows this message: Oops!
An error has occurred.
Please check your payment information and try again.
There's no phone platform
delete what?
ok, we'll try that
ok, thank you, fingers crossed so that this will work
I'm doing it
almost done
great, it worked, thanks a lot, have a nice day
no, thanks, goodbye
Hello, I have a #PRS_ORG# eReader and I can't download the e-books from the library website..
I'm getting an error message from #PRS_ORG#.
This error says that there's a problem with the reading device.
#EMAIL#
I never made any purchase.
Yes, but I can no longer make any transfer.
Unable to download.
Error obtaining license.
Communication problem with the license server.
I haven't made any downloads since fall, because I always get this message.
It doesn't go to #PRS_ORG#.
I used to transfer files with #PRS_ORG#, but with this error message I can't do it
The message comes from the library website.
- No
The library says it's a problem with the app
Do you think I should uninstall and reinstall #PRS_ORG#?
yes, I'll try to take a screenshot.
It won't be long.

Here are the 3 options I have in the Help menu: Authorize the computer (grayed out), Info regarding permission and
#PRS_ORG# Help
In fact, if I go to Info regarding permission, the computer already has the permission
The Authorize again menu is inaccessible
Should I download version 3 of #PRS_ORG# even if it's less recent? It seems to have fewer issues
Thank you
I just downloaded version 4.5.11 and received the same error message.
I wasn't able to authorize the computer again.
It was already authorized.
No, I can’t do that either.
Yes, and I received the same error message.
When do you think I will be contacted?
I had connection issues, sorry.
my eReader rejects some titles from the media library; it says it doesn't have permission #PRS_ORG#, but the computer confirms that it has.
#EMAIL#
no, I read books from the media library to which I have a subscription
The eReader is not authorized by #PRS_ORG#
yes, with no success

No, thank you.
So far I am satisfied with my e-reader.
Enjoy the rest of your day, thanks.
I can't complete an existing order.
Every time I tap on finalize payment, I'm sent back to the verification system 
#EMAIL#
last purchase on 06/01, and one of the books on the list is "Couleurs de l'incendie" by #NAME#
So how do I finalize this order, which amounts to €54.41 and includes 9 books?
Yes, I want to clear them and so on...
When I access my account's payment information settings, it opens a page where there is nothing to update, my #PRS_ORG#
Only a billing information request
it's there, I filled in and saved my #PRS_ORG#'s contact details
Again, when finalizing the payment I'm asked to repeat the verification system: how many trucks, cars, bikes, but no payment
Why did the purchase of 06/01 work but not this one?
I use #PRS_ORG#!
what other browser should I use?
I give up, reordering the whole thing, etc., is too complicated...
I will go to another e-book site.
It's very disappointing to see that the only help you could offer was asking me to change my browser
Especially because it was with #PRS_ORG# that the previous purchase went well and I didn't have to clear any cookies...
that's where I finished my purchase via #PRS_ORG#!
Ok, thank you!
Have a nice day!
I bought a second #PRS_ORG# for my wife.
How can she have access to my library?
mine is #EMAIL#, my wife's has not been created yet, I just gave it to her 
le tatoueur, 3fois plus loin
do you mean that I should link the new eReader to my current account, without setting it up in my wife's name?
Should I configure it in my wife's name using my wife's email and then connect it yo my pc?
my question is simple, but your answer is not... what should do with my second eReader if I want to have access to the books on my first eReader???
so should I connect this second reader to my pc?
no, because I don't know if I have to put it in my name with my own email or in my wife's name with her email?
yes and vice versa, if possible
I haven't created it yet, do I have to?
so I just connect her #PRS_ORG# to my pc without doing anything else?
do I have to configure it?
For the last time... do I need to connect it to MY computer or HER computer before setting up???
Ok, on which of the 2 PCs??
No.
Yes, but your answers are not clear whereas my questions are. Oh, well...
Should I use my computer or my wife's computer?
Hello
Would it be possible to add my BNF: #PRS_ORG# subscription to my #PRS_ORG# eReader?

I see that the books have been added to my account
I can see them from my PC, I will try from my reading device at home, following the process you mentioned.

Problems with the eReader, which is completely frozen following the purchase of two ebooks (this is not the first time)
#EMAIL#.
I had a colleague online and my eReader is completely frozen: gray screen with three dots - books ordered: today
My eReader is frozen and connected to the internet
Books ordered today: la maison du maitre and la berceuse de sang.
Still nothing on the screen, my eReader is connected to the computer and there are three dots on the screen, two of which are black
I just restarted my eReader and it told me to "log in to your account"
A #PRS_ORG# eReader
#PRS_ORG#
but I can't do it.
I can't reach the screen that says sign in to your account above #PRS_ORG#
On the same page there's an option to create a new account and further below there are other connection options
This is where I am
I don't have it on the screen!!
I go back and I get welcome to #PRS_ORG#!
then I set up via Wi-fi
what should I do?
I find the login to your #PRS_ORG# account page 
I connect it with the #PRS_ORG# wifi number, but I'm being asked for a password and I don't have one
yes
in the connect with #PRS_ORG# section
I have my wifi code but this is the password that I am asked page: Connect with #PRS_ORG#
I haven't received it.
It doesn't work. I continue to be blocked regardless of what I do, I'm starting to find it annoying.
No I can't do anything at all. I am stuck on the page that says ‘connect with’ #PRS_ORG# then password
What area of the website should I go to?
My Wi-Fi account? Anything else?
If I go there, I lose access to our communication.
How?
I can't login to the #PRS_ORG# site
on my eReader: #EMAIL#
on my #PRS_ORG# account: #EMAIL#
my last book was bought on December 5, #NUMBER#, Truth by #NAME#
I just talked with your colleague, but despite his instructions I'm unable to log into "#PRS_ORG#"
I can do it on #PRS_ORG#
I would like to merge my two accounts but it doesn't work; your colleague told me it was done, but I'm getting an error message that says the opposite
ok
so how can I log into my #PRS_ORG#
what is #PRS_ORG#
I was already logged onto the #PRS_ORG# site
In any case, it worked, I can buy my book
excellent
thank you for your help
no, that would be all
good evening and thank you again
can I print pages?
#EMAIL#
advf tout en un
purchased on January 10
hello #NAME#
I would like to print some pages
is this possible
in fact, I download it but I'm getting a file error message
it's unacceptable that I can't print a book that I bought
in that case, I should just buy the book
no, but is it normal to get a message saying that the file is damaged?
also, if I bought the book, the publisher has nothing to do with the fact that I want to print some pages, it doesn't make sense
maybe some configurations are wrong, can you please check it?
not via the #PRS_ORG# email
ok, I'll try that
there are no 3 dots, if I had this information I wouldn't have opted for an e-book, I would have ordered the book; can you offer me some compensation so that I can get the book? I'm an instructor and I need support material for those students who want to buy this book*
yes
that's it
yes, I understood, can you offer some compensation?
I want to order the book so that I can receive it and print it
you didn't understand
I'm contacting you again regarding the book that is not on my eReader; I had to use an account from which I had to log out, because it was not the right one, #EMAIL#, where I bought la sence aux alouettes by #NAME# Paule Armand and paid 7.99 euros, order number #PHONENUMBER#
#EMAIL# but for the password I used #NAME# @4/ whereas the current password is #PASSWORD#
Before #NAME# I bought #NAME# in the afternoon, it worked fine
I forgot the date, but it was not long ago, it was a Sunday
yes, the computer underwent some changes as a result of hacking and viruses, a friend who works with computers fixed it for me, but I'm a little lost, nothing looks the same
it's no longer being displayed, but it was there yesterday morning when my friend who works with computers deleted the bad account, and now I don't understand what's going on
neither do I, but I gave you an order number that I retrieved yesterday morning
yes, because it's the last one I bought yesterday morning
So I should wait?
how can I help you?
But I don't know anything about computers, I don't know the process, I'm looking for my book???
What is an eReader?
Can't you call it a reader?
I am only missing one book and it doesn't appear anywhere on the reader or on my books.
I'm trying to finalize a purchase on the #PRS_ORG# app as usual, but I'm unable to do it because after checking, as requested, the 2 series of boat, plane and truck photos, new photos keep coming up.
It's endless!
What's the problem here?
#EMAIL#
On 15/10/#NUMBER#.
yes
ok
I can't register my card because I get a message that reads "Please fill out the captcha".
It's ok.
I hadn't checked the "I am not a robot" box
Let me see.
I tried.
The problem persists.
I checked 2 series of photos thrice and it wasn't finalized!
I only use your #PRS_ORG# app for purchases, but not a server like mozilla or any other.
Maybe the app is no longer up to date?
I'll do that.
New application reinstalled.
It still doesn't work.
More pictures to check, but an error message that says "Oops, an error has occurred.
Please check your payment information and try again."
I'll try.
I was able to finalize my purchase in the website but I am unable to sync my reader with the site.
I'll do that.
Good.
Successful synchronization.
From now on, I will go through the site.
Thank you.
Because it took time.
Have a nice day
Hello, I'm a 65-year-old woman, I'm trying to solve a problem with my eReader and I'm very worried because I think I lost my books; my problem was that I was trying to get some books from the library
My address is still #NAME#
thank you
I'm still on the same page, which says that my password is incorrect and that it will send the new one by email
sorry, it takes a long time to write with only one finger, I'm not very skillful
no, I get them from the library
but I love my eReader
yes
it's turned on and when I try to log into #PRS_ORG#, I enter the email and the password but it doesn't work, there's an error, it says it will send me an email, but the email doesn't arrive, I tried it 6 times
yes I tapped it
yes
I did that
but my password was supposed to be reset, please wait a moment
this functionality is not working right now, thank you for your patience
no, this functionality is not working right now
and there's a arrow at the top
yes
if it's not too complicated
thank you, #NAME#
yes, please download it
done
I can't complete my order.
It just stays in the cart.
The procedure does not end with the secure transaction step.
#EMAIL#
Today
This is the first time
I'm using my personal computer and there's no error message
OK
#PRS_ORG#
If I do that, will I lose my connection with you?
ok, I did the procedures
What next...
I CAN'T ACCESS MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT'S SAYING THAT MY EMAIL ADDRESS IS #EMAIL#, WHICH IS PRINTED
#EMAIL#
I never bought any ebook and my current tablet was a gift, but I bought one about 3 or 4 years ago
I cannot log into my account
but how do I do it, I don't know how to sync my tablet
That is gibberish to an 80-year-old reader, I connected my eReader to my computer, which is asking for my wifi network ID, but there are no upper case letters on the eReader
yes
It's telling me to sync it and access a network, it recognizes my #PRS_ORG# at the bottom, it's telling me to refresh it, but nothing happens, and if I press add a network, a window asks me for the password
I don't understand what you mean, I also wanted to tell you that the last sync took place on 30/7:#NUMBER#, when I received the eReader
Sync is done, the app is downloading
yes, the download is in progress, at 5%
THIS WILL TAKE #PRS_ORG#
YES, THE SYNC IS IN PROGRESS
YES, THAT'S THE WITH MY ACCOUNT, I CAN'T ACCESS IT, THE MESSAGE SAYS THAT MY EMAIL IS NOT VALID
OK I WILL TRY AGAIN DO I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE END OF SYNCHRONISATION
I will resume later and I will try to connect thanks for your help and patience
Hello, I cannot log in to my #PRS_ORG# account with my #PRS_ORG# credentials and password.
It tells me that I already have an existing account with that same address, and when I try to combine the accounts, it tells me that this is not the right email address!
Thank you for your help,
I do not know. I wanted to create a new account and it does not work; it tells me that this email address already exists.
Thus, I have two addresses: #PRS_ORG# which is my #PRS_ORG# and EMAIL-1 address that would already exist for #PRS_ORG# but does not work
I bought 2 books 2 days ago I believe
For #PRS_ORG#?
Ok, how?
Without going through #PRS_ORG#
How?
#PRS_ORG# asks me to access all my personal information to link the accounts and I disagree...
Yes, thank you very well.
I have not received the email yet
Can I test now or do I have to wait for the removal of the #PRS_ORG# account?
Thank you.
I hope it works after that!
Have a nice day
do I wait for a response in the chat?
ok
goodbye
How do I allow my #PRS_ORG# to receive the #PRS_ORG# book, which has already been downloaded
ok
#EMAIL#
I get my books from the central #PRS_ORG# library
ok
I have a new computer and I just realized that I had forgotten to download #PRS_ORG#; I just did that and #PRS_ORG# is fine
But it says that I have to authorize 
my #PRS_ORG# to get this book
yes
I'm getting this message on my #PRS_ORG#: this book is protected by #PRS_ORG#.
you must authorize your eReader
again with the #PRS_ORG# ID using #PRS_ORG#
ok....
I think I changed it because this #PRS_ORG# password is dated December 31, 2020, which was when this new computer arrived.
I think so, because #PRS_ORG# works with my hotmail, so I wanted to keep it because of the other things it has
yes, 3 weeks ago, I managed to do it
I worked for many years with 2 libraries, Mascouche and #PRS_ORG#
this is my 2nd #PRS_ORG#
if I delete the 3 versions,
I will have to ask the library again, I'll do it again
maybe it's good for #NUMBER# hours.
Or find #PRS_ORG#
Ok, wait a minute..... done
done, all book versions reappeared, weird
ok
how do I authorize my reader, I allowed the computer, but it does not show how to do so for the reader....
yes
I just found it, yesss... that had to be the problem.
I'll try to reload the file
They have to book it
Again to the great library, it should work, I won't ask you to wait for me it will be a little long.
Thank you very much....

If I sync the book is not displayed

still no book
is it possible that I have two accounts?
MAYBE THAT'S THE CAUSE
#EMAIL#
but on my previous #PRS_ORG# I had an account under #EMAIL#
I had a lot of books on this account, but I can't merge them
I'll try that
it worked!
how can I merge these two accounts to have all my books on the same account?
Ok, so I need to change the account settings on my eReader and log into the #PRS_ORG# account?
#PRS_ORG#
yes, it's in progress
configuration and syncing
downloading covers

Since I downloaded ebooks with my #PRS_ORG# card, I can no longer choose books in the discover section.
Moreover, the books there are in English.
#EMAIL#
on the #PRS_ORG# account today and on the #PRS_ORG# account on 25/12, but I reset my #PRS_ORG# since then and lost them
I paid my 25/12 purchases with my bank card
thank you
on my #PRS_ORG#, the address is
sorry, #EMAIL# on the #PRS_ORG# site EMAIL-1
The two books I purchased with my card were billed on December 25, #NUMBER#, 1.99 euros each book, which were ordered separately (so two invoices), zip code #NUMBER#, credit card: #NUMBER#........... #NUMBER#
excuse me, #NAME#
yes, I don't understand why I can't choose recent books with my #PRS_ORG#
When I enter a title in the discover search, #PRS_ORG# suggests books that do not match my search, and this didn't happen before.
In addition, prices are shown in dollars
Thank you for this information, I will do it, but one last question, I still have credit on my #PRS_ORG# card, will this "disrupt" my orders?
Thank you for all this information.
So I'll wait for the follow-up when my two purchased books have been found by #PRS_ORG# support.
Have a nice day, regards.
Hello, I bought more than #NUMBER# books from you, now I want to buy another one, but your defective Captcha system is preventing me from doing so, even after more than 50 attempts.
You no longer want my money, I used to pay and that would be it, I never had any problem, but now...!
Disable this stupid thing so that I can make my purchases, and don't talk to me about "customer protection."
Thank you.

I have a #PRS_ORG# account and my old email address is on #PRS_ORG#, I think it's #EMAIL# but I'm not sure anymore
I'll see, wait a moment!

I managed to update my payment card but not my email address, it doesn't work since #PRS_ORG#.
Website

But there I'm immediately redirected to #PRS_ORG#
Listen, I'm old but I'm not stupid, when #PRS_ORG# asks me how many cars, zebra crosses or motorcycles there are on those excessively small photos and I answer more than 50 times, the problem is not me.
I know the "I'm not a robot" system
no, I won't do that, sorry, I told you that with the #PRS_ORG# site I always end up on INT.EXPLO.
Forget it, I'm the one who has to fix your issues so that I can spend my money, as usual.
Thanks for the assistance attempt, but it's too much :(
So #PRS_ORG# didn't receive my last email, please wish him a good night
I'm #NUMBER# years old, I no longer have your keyboard speed and I'm writing with only one finger, forget it, thank you
I'm still here, I reviewed and took note of your information, but I will take care of it tomorrow, have a good evening
Hello, on January 1, #NUMBER#, I bought the complete UIvy Wilde by #NAME#, which is part of the Collection Infinity, on your site.
I have a concern about the file, on volume 1, chapter 23 is interposed between chapters 16 and 17.
I contacted Collection Infinity, and they told me that they have sent you the corrected file and that I should have received an update request from you.
I didn't receive anything and I downloaded the book on my eReader again, but the problem persists.
Please force the update so that I can finally have the book with the chapters in the right order.
Thank you in advance

That is not what I am asking. I have done all the steps as I pay for my books with a registered card, but at Christmas, I added some gift cards with which I would like to pay directly on my #PRS_ORG#.
No it asks me to pay with my usual credit card.

And I get the message CE_COPY_NOT_ALLOWED when I try to open the book on the eReader
I did it several times, it was mentioned in your files
yes, I did that too
I contacted the library from which I borrowed the book and the problem is not on their side, as I can open the book on my PC; the problem is with the eReader, which freezes because of the #PRS_ORG#
a new version was launched in early 2020 on #PRS_ORG#, it doesn't have the same layout, is it possible to switch to the previous version?#PRS_ORG#

thank you
Log in with my account

then I was told to log in with #PRS_ORG#
I enter the email address and the password, but it doesn't work
Exactly
Yes, it's saved on my phone, I downloaded the app with the same email address and the same password, but it doesn't work on the e-reader
no, I checked when entering it
I even recreated a new address and nothing worked, neither the first one nor the second
how can I fix this?
The two passwords were identical
it says log in to your account or create a new account then continue with #PRS_ORG# or log in with #PRS_ORG#
which link should I click on?
I'll try it right away
it worked
thank you.
how can I download books now?
free books at first, so that I can familiarize myself with the eReader?
Must the eReader be connected to a computer or is it possible on #PRS_ORG#?
If I understood correctly, I must first download a book on the computer and then download it on the eReader?
Thank you very much for all these explanations

Hello,
I tried to purchase some ebooks on 23/01/#NUMBER#.
However, there was a problem with the application, an error message was displayed at the end of the transaction, saying that it had failed.
I tried several times with the same result, and without getting the ebooks.
However, I can see in my bank account that the charges were processed.
So I would like to have all my 23/01/#NUMBER# purchases cancelled on the app.
Best regards
#EMAIL#
#NAME#
That's right, and I didn't get the ebooks
I bought them via the #PRS_ORG# app on android
L'innocente des highlands, l'épouse ennemie and mystères sur les highlands
Since it didn't work on the app, I ended up buying them via #PRS_ORG#, so they should be on my account.
But I don't understand why the #PRS_ORG# charges were processed
No, it's the only one.
However, in my bank account, the charges are being processed

When I go to the #URL# site with my account, I can see all the books I purchased, but when I use my phone app, I can only see the last book I bought, Ville de papier, and the new Magie-Now is nowhere to be found
I read books on my iPhone
I did it several times, but it didn't work
I also deleted the app several times, but it didn't work
I'm contacting you from my #PRS_ORG# computer, but I read my books on my iPhone
yes, several times and again just 1 minute ago
Only one book is displayed on my iPhone (ville de papier, bought a few weeks ago, and yes, I can open it
As I said, I deleted the app several times and waited the necessary 10 minutes
ok, I just deleted the app again
I have 2 choices: uninstall or delete
ok, I just found it, I logged out
ok, now I see all my books except the one I bought a few weeks ago: Ville de papier??
a few weeks ago.
Before contacting you, it was the only book that was being displayed on the app...
Les villes de papier by #NAME#
I'm looking for it
I can't find it
I paid for it with an indigo gift card
I don't keep all my emails!!!
Once it was downloaded, I had to delete the email...
No, I have only one email for 7-8 years
Before chatting with you, I had it in my app!!!
Your system works poorly and I have to waste a lot of time solving your problems, and now you tell me that you have lost one of my books!
I have the same email for 7-8 years!!!
What is the phone number so I can complain?
Please give me a phone number
It is a book of 12$!!!
Do you think I keep all my invoices, especially after the book is downloaded??
I have already wasted too much time with this. Please give me a phone number and I will call later
I will call later
I paid with a gift card!

Why did I have to return the #PRS_ORG# eReader before January 5 but did not receive the #PRS_ORG#, which by the way is not free of charge
#EMAIL#
I don't remember
Delivery is at #ADDRESS#
I bought a #PRS_ORG# eReader in late December, but I received another #PRS_ORG#, so I already have one. Therefore, I returned it before Jan 5 as per #URL#, but I've been waiting for several days and you haven't done anything
I did that before Jan 5
You received it but you're taking too long to send me the #PRS_ORG#
What's wrong
You received my #PRS_ORG# before Jan 5, as requested
#NAME# talked
with a gentleman who told me you had received it and that I would get the #PRS_ORG# in a few days, but it's been more than a week
I sent a #PRS_ORG# before Jan 5, as you had asked me
I had ordered a #PRS_ORG# in dec.
#NAME# received a #PRS_ORG# instead of a #PRS_ORG#
Then I returned the #PRS_ORG#, which you received.
So we were supposed to receive a #PRS_ORG# in the exchange.
But we've waiting for more than a week
What's the problem
What is delaying the shipment of the #PRS_ORG#.
It's pretty simple to me,,,
what are you waiting for to send me the #PRS_ORG# I paid for
I'll be waiting for your email and I hope you fix this situation soon..
no, thanks

I would like to reactivate it, how do I do it?

I bought the #PRS_ORG# in 2013, I think, I bought #NAME# on the same occasion (Christmas) and I didn't buy anything after that because I didn't use it.
I want to open it, but it's asking for my code and saying that my account has been disabled

Good evening, I changed my email address and the books associated to my old email address (which no longer exists) have disappeared from my #PRS_ORG# reader.
How do I find them please?
Thank you.

I still can't sync my last purchases, oops!!
No, I don't think so and I'm sorry but I'm really not tech savvy. My reader tells me on its #PRS_ORG# that I am connected and that it is loading, but nothing happens after that
The name of several languages appear on the screen of my reader. What should I do?
What should I do now?
Some of my last purchases are already downloaded and others are pending. What does it mean?
I don't understand why I need to download again books that I've read on my reader, and when I click on 'download', it says 'pending'.
Thanks a lot #NAME#, I will try solve this myself because every time I press the Download key it indicates that it is pending. Does it mean that the download will be done later or that I need to synchronize with the computer as I did before?
Thank you very much #NAME#, I have 19 books still pending, but it seems that the problems can be solved with a little patience (patience that I have with humans, but not very much with the machines!!!!!!!!!
I wish you a good evening. Thanks a lot, #NAME#

My wife's account being associated with my #PRS_ORG# account, you automatically assigned me all the books from my wife's library.
How to dissociate the two?

I'm lost now. I didn't open my #PRS_ORG# account
it is always the email address of my wife that appears, yet the e-Reader indicates that my email address already exists
#NAME# tells me that we cannot merge our 2 accounts and my email address already exists
yes

yes
I do not know how to do
what to do?
yes, but now it no longer recognizes my email address.
Would not it be easier for me to reset my e-Reader by creating a new account?
I think I am going to switch off everything and try again tomorrow, hoping my wife has not lost all her books.
In any case, this start-up is not easy!
thank you for your help and good evening

Hello, a long time ago I used the #PRS_ORG# account #EMAIL# to buy and download books to my ipad.
That address will no longer be used and will be deleted.
I would like to transfer my points, purchases, etc. to my #PRS_ORG# account.

The issue is not the address.
It's the #PRS_ORG# account.
I cannot change my login address because these purchases were made with the #PRS_ORG# account only.
I will no longer use the #PRS_ORG# and I would like to transfer my purchases to the #PRS_ORG# EMAIL-1 account.

In this case, I see you have a billing address from Australia.
That's why you were charged with that currency.
Did you purchased from the Australian website?
In this case, I would advise you to update the billing address by following these steps:
#URL#
In order to not have issues, please use the address from France.
However, since you're not currently in that region, some books might not work if they have a region restriction.
We could process a refund.
Would that be okay?
If we process the refund as Store Credit you will probably have it as #PRS_ORG# because of your current address.
So if you can't change the address at the moment, I would advise the refund back to your payment method.
You're welcome.
Please let me know when the change is complete.
How is it going?
Great news!
Allow me one moment to process the refund, please.
I just processed the refund and the Store Credit has been added to your account.
However, it was added in #PRS_ORG#.
Allow me one moment so we can change it to euros, please.
I'm still with you, please bear with me one moment.
Now the Store Credit was changed to euros.

#PRS_ORG#
#PRS_ORG# is a third party app (from #PRS_ORG# not #PRS_ORG#) however we can recommend afew steps to try to correct this as advised by the source (#PRS_ORG#)
First, reset the authorization on your #PRS_ORG#
Make sure the date and time settings on your #PRS_ORG# eReader are correct.
You should find these in the Settings menu on your #PRS_ORG#.
Plug your #PRS_ORG# into your computer (using the USB cable that came with your #PRS_ORG#).
Open #PRS_ORG# on your computer.
Use #PRS_ORG# to delete the eBook that's causing issues from your #PRS_ORG# and your computer (make sure to choose the Remove from Library option).
Click on your #PRS_ORG# under the "Devices" menu on the left.
Click device options gear icon next to "Devices," then select Erase Device Authorization.
Click Erase Authorization, then OK to confirm.
Try to reset the authorization in #PRS_ORG#
In #PRS_ORG#, press Ctrl + Shift + D (Command + Shift + D on a Mac) on your keyboard.
In the pop-up window that opens, enter the password for your #PRS_ORG# ID or #PRS_ORG# account (and make sure the correct #PRS_ORG# ID is listed in the drop-down menu).
Then, click Continue.
Select Erase Authorization, then OK.
Authorize your computer again by going to Help > Authorize Computer.
Note: Make sure to reauthorize your computer using the same #PRS_ORG# ID as before.
Otherwise, you won't be able to re-download your eBook
Try transferring the eBook again
Re-download the eBook that was causing issues
Transfer the eBook from #PRS_ORG# to your #PRS_ORG#.
This step will also reauthorize your #PRS_ORG#.
Try opening the title on your #PRS_ORG#.
Note that if you have installed the version #PRS_ORG#, this may be the source of the problem.
Unfortunately, #PRS_ORG# malfunctions with certain books which are in #PRS_ORG# format at the time of transfer to the reader.
#PRS_ORG# very slightly changes the digital lock code (#PRS_ORG#), and this change is not recognized by #PRS_ORG#.
The #PRS_ORG# format is a widely used standard, but #PRS_ORG# seems to only be able to process books in the #PRS_ORG# format.
This is why with #PRS_ORG# some books are transferable and others are not.
Thank you for the information.
I will be more than happy to assist you.
Nice to meet you, #NAME#.
I hope you are having a great day!
I apologize but I'm unable to verify your account with the eBook title provided.
Please provide me with an eBook purchased through your account.
You are not able to transfer an #PRS_ORG# file from your android to your eReader.
The file needs to be on your computer to be able to transfer it.
You can only import it to your #PRS_ORG#.
No, as mentioned above and it can only be transferred to your #PRS_ORG#.
To add a non-protected #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG# file to your eReader:
Turn on your eReader.
Connect the micro USB cable to your eReader and to your computer.
On your eReader, tap Connect when you see the 'Computer detected' window.
On your computer, look for a drive named '#PRS_ORG#'.
Drag the #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG# files into the '#PRS_ORG# eReader' drive.
Eject your eReader:
Right-click on the '#PRS_ORG#' drive on your computer's desktop and click Eject.
Unplug the USB cable from your eReader.
You'll see a "Importing content" message on your eReader.
To find the file you just added on your eReader:

Tap the name of the book you added to start reading.

You can download the book files to your computer in order to transfer and read them into a different device or with a different reading program.
Just bear in mind that if files are protected by #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#) they will download as the special file URLLink.ascm and will require an additional program like the free #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#) to be opened in a non-#PRS_ORG# device or #PRS_ORG# reader program.
If the files are not protected (#PRS_ORG#-Free) they will download as normal #PRS_ORG# and can be transferred to other devices without the need of additional steps.
If a book file is protected by Digital Rights or not, depends entirely of the publishers.
To download the files of your books into your computer, please follow these steps:
1
Go to #URL# and sign into your account.

I'm contacting you about a problem I have with an ebook.
This is the ebook "Alice in #PRS_ORG#."

But that is not the case.

The book opens on the #PRS_ORG# app as well as via #PRS_ORG# but I still have the same problem: Pages 56 and 57 are duplicated so I miss a page.
However, the publisher confirmed to me that he had changed it.
I have the same problem whether the file is downloaded via the #PRS_ORG# application or with the #PRS_ORG# application.
I'd prefer you to report it thank you.

My husband has just contacted you (#EMAIL#) about this, and he was told that it is possible transfer the books purchased to a single tablet by deleting my husband's account.
#NAME#: Le disparu de Larvik
#NAME#: la papeterie Tsubaki
Only one account, mine, if it is possible to download e-books to 2 readers at the same time
or both, if e-books can be transferred between readers.
in that, case a single account accessible via the 2 readers
Okay

I just bought a #PRS_ORG# reader, I'm trying to read a book in Arabic, but there's a huge latency when I go from one page to another.
#EMAIL#
I haven't bought #PRS_ORG# books yet.
It's not a page refresh problem, books in English or French work very well, but as soon as I open a book in Arabic, the time from one page to another takes several seconds, sometimes even a minute.
Is there an address for the technical team or a complaint page to request support for the Arabic language?
Thank you.
Hello, I can no longer download books with my computer, despite #PRS_ORG# being on my computer.

No, they come from an online media library.
Do you know how to cancel the authorization?
Thank you.
Thank you very much!
Good evening and good morning.
The battery of my #PRS_ORG#, bought in April #NUMBER# (order #ALPHANUMERIC_ID# - serial number #ALPHANUMERIC_ID#) drains very quickly (a maximum of 3 to 4 hours of reading after a full charge).
What to do?
#EMAIL# I connect with my #PRS_ORG# account.
I don't know, the #PRS_ORG# reader, I bought directly from you.
Order number #ALPHANUMERIC_ID# of April 22, 2020
Yes, I bought it recently, but before using the sleep cover, the problem was already occurring.
Yes, last week.
I did a factory reset a few days ago, no result.
Yes, I installed the desktop app.
Yes.
On the #PRS_ORG# site, order no #ALPHANUMERIC_ID# of 22 April 2020
Thank you for your help, I am waiting for your e-mail.
Have a good day.
Hello, my #PRS_ORG# reader only offers me English-language books to buy in dollars while it is connected to my #PRS_ORG# account, which offers me French-language books in euros.
#EMAIL#
The dresser with colored drawers.
Understood.
I turn on my computer.
Yes.
I registered an address and credit card on the #PRS_ORG# account.
I will disconnect the reader.
I wait 3 minutes before reconnecting the reader to the #PRS_ORG# account.
I reconnected the reader.
Perfect, you solved my problem.
Thank you very much for your availability on this holiday.
Does the #PRS_ORG# reader support audio books?
Ok, thank you. Merry christmas and happy new year.
We just bought a #PRS_ORG#.
We borrowed a book (.#PRS_ORG#) from our library with our #PRS_ORG# (#PRS_ORG#).
The #PRS_ORG# recognizes the #PRS_ORG# when it is connected via USB.
We can't transfer the book.
#EMAIL#
no book in the account, we can't copy it from our #PRS_ORG#!
yes
We can read the book on #PRS_ORG#, but we can't copy it to #PRS_ORG#
"The complicated life of #NAME# volume 13.1" by #NAME#
If I create a different #PRS_ORG# account on another computer (#PRS_ORG#), can I transfer it via #PRS_ORG# or does it take two identical accounts on a computer and on #PRS_ORG#?
since we are just beginning (only 1 rented book), the important thing for us is to be able to use #PRS_ORG#
So all books must come from a #PRS_ORG# account, right?
What is the meaning of the message "Cannot Download.
Error obtaining license.
E_LIC_ALREADY_FUFILLES_BY_ANOTHER_USER"?
however, they are the same
Since she couldn't copy it, my daughter is reading the book on her #PRS_ORG# book.
Is that the reason we can't copy it anymore?
license from #PRS_ORG#?
No, it is a book borrowed from the Quebec library, which we got from the link #PRS_ORG#
ok
okay, we'll do that.
Thank you.

In fact, when I download and drag them into the file of my reader, after opening my reader, I see the downloaded file but it is black and I cannot open it.

Ok I'll do that.
There, it's done, but unfortunately

I read books on a #PRS_ORG# tablet and it has always worked.
Please find a solution so that I can add this book to my library.
Given its low price, I can try to buy it a third time if necessary.
I'm afraid that this problem may happen again when I buy a more expensive book....
I never needed that with my other purchases.

Hello,
my daughter has her own #PRS_ORG#, I would like her to have access to my account so that she can read my books, but I can't change her account (created by my husband)
my account: #PRS_ORG#
in my daughter's settings, the address is that of my husband: #PRS_ORG#
I would like my daughter to have access to my account
I should sign out on my daughter's eReader and sign in again?
I'll try
it's signed out
done.
I'm logging into your account
I forgot my password!
What is the password?
does it consist of numbers?
for my #PRS_ORG# account
my computer signs in automatically
what if I click forgotten password on my daughter's #PRS_ORG#?
I forgot my password and I can't change it on the #NAME# account
so it doesn't work
I do want the link
I just changed the password, it doesn't work with my daughter's #PRS_ORG#
done.
It says "account not found"
yes, everything is correct
no, it tells me to sign in with #PRS_ORG#
no, I don't see how to do that
should I leave this screen by selecting the arrow in the top left corner?
in "more connection options" there is #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG#
should I select #PRS_ORG#?
in a long list
THANK YOU, #NAME#!!!!!
IT WORKED!!!!!
No thanks, it's perfect, I hope I won't need your help in the future :-)
thank you in the name of my daughter as well.

However, the synchronization was done.
Can you help me?

Hello,
I bought the ebook Ascendance of a bookworm Part 3 Volume 3.
After downloading it to my eReader (via the #PRS_ORG# app), all I get is a preview, not the full book.
I tried removing it and downloading it again, but I always get the same result.
How do I download the correct book?
Thank you
#EMAIL#
It should be noted that I make the purchases via #PRS_ORG#
This was on January 4
It's a #PRS_ORG# eReader
#PRS_ORG# if I remember correctly
yes, that's right
Is it on the eReader menu?
I don't see that option.
OR do I have to do it with the #PRS_ORG# app on my PC?
Oh yes, I see it on the app, I'm launching it
Done.
Yes, thank you, I had not checked the device information, but the account section
But nothing changed regarding the book, do I have to remove it and download it again?
Done
I signed out from the app and the eReader, waited for 3 minutes, and signed in on the app again
I use the app to retrieve the books on the eReader because I'm having wifi connection issues
The app has just finished resyncing, but nothing has changed regarding the book
It's there, but it's still a preview and not the full book, nothing has changed
After singing in again, I didn't do anything with this particular ebook, but the app seems to have downloaded at least some of them on its own
Should I remove it and download it again?
Sorry, I started before I saw your message
The ebook is here again, I'll wait for your message before doing anything
I'm offline
Syncing is over, still the same issue
The book is incomplete, it's only an excerpt and not the full book
the ebook opens (and it has always opened), but the content is not the full book
on the app
but on Monday I retrieved it on the eReader and it was the same
No, I didn't connect it while we were doing these actions
I can connect it, but if the book does not show correctly in the app, I guess it will be the same on the eReader
The table of contents is only the Cover and the Preview, and it's only 25 pages
uninstalled, reinstalled, no change
I don't think the installation is the problem here, the comments on the book at the store show that I'm not the only one facing this problem
No change
Ok, I tried to contact them first, but I didn't succeed
Yes, it makes sense
Thanks anyway, have a nice day
Hello, I bought a book on my eReader today.

Hi NAME-M, nice to meet you.
It is system that disconnects the chat if you become .
No worries let me help you out further.
Okay so I was saying could you please give me the game code that you got at the time of purchase?
Okay so could you please share me the invoice number?
Okay so this is not an invoice number of our site which basically means that you bought the game from a different store.
So that store has your money that you paid for the purchase of the game so I would request you to contact that store and they will be the one to give you your money back.
Hope you understand.
Okay so let me try this again.
We can only give you the money that we have taken from but in your case you have bought the game from a different store so don't you think they will be the one to give you that money back?
I hope you what I am trying to say.
The game is ours but you bought it from them.
If you would have bought it from PRS-ORG then I would have tried to refund you the money.
But now literally I can't see any records of purchase.
Hope you understand this.
No we can't that is what I am trying to say from the start.
But so If there is anything else I can help you with please do let me know.
But If there is anything else I can help you with please do let me know.

Need for Speed Most Wanted is PRS-ORG product, however purchase and membership related issues are dealt by respective store support.
We manage the services of PRS-ORG store.
I would recommend you to contact PRS-ORG support for better information.
Yes, I can understand that, but we manage services of PRS-ORG on PRS-ORG.
As you have active membership on PRS-ORG, for this you will need to contac
t PRS-ORG support to fix it.
It really breaks my heart to redirect our dedicated players like you to the correct support teams when they contact us about our games.
Although we only do that as that's the only way to resolve the issue.
As per the information we have, both are different platforms and games are platform specific.
So if you want to access the game on both platform, you will need to purchase membership both on PRS-ORG and PRS-ORG.
For better information, I would recommend you to contact PRS-ORG support.
I am thankful to you for being co-operative throughout this case.

Hello NAME-F.
Link issues are never fun and we're here to help.
Let's bring up the account and take a look into this.
What's your PRS-ORG screen name?
Thank you.
It looks like your PSN is attached to a deleted account.
Do you know what email you had on that account originally?
If you know the original email that was on the PRS-ORG account, you can reset your password and it may reactivate the account.
If you can't do that, then I'm afraid you wont be able to play PRS-ORG games on that PSN ID.
You would have to use a different PSN ID for the time being
I wish I had any additional information you.
You can still use your games on a different PSN account and attach it to your new PRS-ORG account.
Do you have any additional questions for me while we're here?
It's up to you of course but that would be the only way for you to play as your other PRS-ORG account is attached to a deleted PRS-ORG account that you cannot access it seems.
I hope you're able to regain access to it and enjoy your games.
If you have any other issues feel free to contact us back at URL.
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG help and have a great day!

I am sorry that you are experiencing this issue, I will do my best to assist you.
In this case there are a couple of procedures you can try to solve the error message, is your ereader updated?
Alright, so the date and time are correct?
This can affect the authorization on the ereader
Okay, so the first procedure is to remove the authorization from both computer and ereader and delete the affected, then reauthorize the computer and the ereader and download the book again from the original source
if you already tried that you can try to uninstall PRS-ORG and reinstall it again
you can also try to use both versions of PRS-ORG, 3.0 and 4.5.11
if the issue persists you can try a factory reset on your device but this will delete all the books on the ereader
We suggest to backup all your books if you want to try the factory reset
Unfortunately ADE is a third party program and we have some information about how to solve some issues but we are not experts on the product, we can always guarantee the service the service with PRS-ORG books but issues related to books provided by another servers different than PRS-ORG can be sometimes difficult to solve
If the previous steps are not working you can definitely contact the book provider and request to reset the DRM license of the book, that should also solve the issue with the error message
are you still online?
I will close this chat now since no response has been received.
I will gladly continue assisting you via email, or you can contact us again at a more convenient time for you.

however, there is a possibility of a game-breaking bug in this scenario.
I will be reporting this to the concerned team so this can be investigated, and if there are any issues found on the game, it should be fixed and you should be able to play the game without an issue.
However, we will not be able to provide a direct update on this to you.
If there are any changes on the game or updates, you should be able to see it in the patch notes/ game updates.

I can understand the feeling.
I understand that sometimes it can be hard to get desired players from the packs.
However, I can assure you that the packs are entirely random.
Even we at PRS-ORG cannot predict the content of a packs without opening them.
While you have spent real money in the game, please note that the amount of the money spent on the game has no affect on the chances of getting a player from a pack.
This has been done to make sure everyone has equal chances in the game.
So It totally depends on your luck what you are getting in your packs after opening it.
We don't have any control on it to re-correct it from our end.
it all depends on the luck.
it is granted by the sever
randomly and it is fully automated.

I'm NAME-M, can I ask for your first name please to start?
Hello my name is NAME-M
I am contacting you because PRS-ORG has withdrawn from me 950 000 credits on PRS-ORG ultimate team
For reasons that I do not know because the credits I had were earned thanks to players I had in the packs, I sent the photos
And by buying and selling.
I would like to recover my credits, it is a huge sum!
I challenge the sanction!
PSN: ALPHANUMERICID
email address: EMAIL
I just sent 150 000 credits from another account!
I never did anything illegal!
And all the rest I had won it myself.
And PRS-ORG took everything away from me!
And when I go to my banned / suspended history, I have nothing displayed
On help.PRS-ORG
I never broke PRS-ORG rules
Yes I want to thank you because it is a huge sum!
Thank you
So I don't do anything anymore?
I'm just waiting for an answer by email?
Thank you.
I hope to recover at least the
half of my credits
I sent proof by photo before starting this case with you
I don't know if you have access to it?
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG Support.
I'm NAME-F, can I ask for your first name please to start?
Hello
My name is NAME-M
Thank you, so here I have encountered for the 2nd time a problem in online Draft mode on PRS-ORG
indeed I pay 300 PRS-ORG points (therefore money) I decide to start a match
and as soon as I'm gone I'm disconnected
surely cheaters
but it's the 2nd time since I draft
and i'm getting fed up with getting ripped off like this
I would like a refund of the points
ok thanks to you.
No problem.
They tell me that I am not eligible
I just lost 300 PRS-ORG points because you can't fix this problem
then you will reimburse me
i paid
and i lost money
so now i want a refund
it's not normal to do that, the players of your game lose money because of cheating
and you do not repay?
find a way to reimburse me
I wouldn't leave without my refund
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG Support.
I'm NAME-M, may I ask your first name please to start?

my subscription is active with PRS-ORG

Hello and happy new year 2021,
I can no longer log in to my PRS-ORG account online, the reset of my password does not give anything and when I log in with my PRS-ORG ID, I am told that it already exists with an account.
On the other hand, since my reader, the downloads are normally done.
Could you help me ?
Best regards
EMAIL
No, since I can no longer enter my account, but I have just found on my account statement 2 small invoices of February 18, 202020
The acquisition of my reader dates back to the end of December 2017.
thank you
45000
Received and it works; my last 2 small paid purchases actually go back to February 16, 202020, the sums are the same as on my statement.
It's good, I just logged in under Edge and PRS-ORG and put your homepage in favorites.
Case settled, thanks for your help and good Sunday to you.
Thanks, just a purchase proposal: "Frivolity is a serious affair" by Frédéric Beigbedder but from the pocket format that just released, so cheaper than the large format released in 2018.
It's good for me.
Happy day to you.
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG Support.

Hello
Last night I launched a fut23 session.
I collected stars and bought a draft token
I used the token and created my equipe draft online
At the launch of the 1st match, the change never came to fruition.
After 30 minutes of waiting, I switched the console off and on again.
The game tells me I've left the game, so I've lost my chip and now have a handicap on future matches for quitting.
Can you remedy this?
Are you still there?
Thank you
Thanks for the feedback, I already tried it last night.
But the application tells me I'm not eligible.
It's quite scandalous, I must say.
I spent 2 h on the game for this.
Yes.
Thank you.
I look forward to hearing from you soon

I haven't made any purchases and I don't have any audiobooks.
my liseusse was bought in September.
Yes thanks
since yesterday i have been trying to add books from my adobe to my liseusse.
but this one always tells me that I am not authorizing.
I removed all my permissions and put it back afterwards and no changes.
I followed all the steps I found on your site but it doesn't work.
the error message i have on my liseusse is: this book is protected by PRS-ORG digital rights maangement (drm).
having previously disauthorized your e-reader, you must re-import it using PRS-ORG digital editions (ade)
but it is authorized everywhere on my computer as on the e-reader
but I already have a PRS-ORG account
I have had my e-reader since September.
in December I contacted you for the same matter.
It means that in 1 year it's been two times that I have had problems.
I love my e-reader, but when it causes me problems like that, I don't want to recommend it to people around me.
if i follow your steps i will lose my connection with you.
I'm on my computer
i disable my permissions and uninstall adobe.
I will restart my computer and reload adobe

Yesterday I contacted your services because I can not pre-download PRS-ORG, I was told that normally everything will have to be settled quickly .. but this is not the case, I have to pre-order to play it tomorrow , if I can't download it, that means I can't play it tomorrow.
I therefore wish to cancel this pre-order and that I can re-order the game, hoping that this time it works
Thank you for agreeing to respond favorably to my request :)
Of course

Hello I am contacting you to let you know of my dissatisfaction.
I have been playing PRS-ORG 10 on PRS-ORG since, I have always loved this game.
FUT mode is the mode that has kept me going since PRS-ORG 12.
It is clear that I stop playing PRS-ORG earlier and earlier in the year over time.
PRS-ORG champions mode is the mode that made me want to continue, but now it's very difficult to access it ... rank 3 has a rank 2 match last week, and no way to qualify this week .
I hope for an update very soon for the change of qualification to champion, otherwise I don't think I will touch the games anymore.
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG Support.
I'm NAME-M, can I ask for your first name please to start?
Hello not too much with my qualification was compromised champions, and impossible for me to redo 1500 points plus the 9 qualifying matches before this weekend
Sorry?
Are you going to change the qualification system?
Thanks, I really hope that will change.
I like the ultimate team mode, I like to play in was champions.
I have the impression that to access it and have good rewards, you have to be a very good player or have a very big team.
Hoping that it will change very soon see you soon, otherwise unfortunately goodbye PRS-ORG
Thank you very much, I hope I'm not the only one to make things happen quickly.
No at all thank you.
Good day good luck and hope for a very quick update

Well, an investigation is currently being done on my PRS-ORG account because I got hacked the day before yesterday
Can I still use my account during the investigation?
Because I mainly play PRS-ORG so having to wait several days is quite annoying
Okay, perfect, you don't have any time to give me?
Because it's complicated when you have nothing left in your club
Very good, well I thank you
No nothing thank you
Hello
Hi, my name is NAME-M.

So what can I do for you today?
You can change your phone number at any time.
Note: You can only register one phone number to your account, but the PRS-ORG application (for the Air terminal) can be installed on different smartphones.
Since changing a phone number is beyond my virtual assistant skills, I will transfer you to an agent.

Your game is starting to swell me!
The same problem as the last futchamp
this time in my draft
Too many guys raging so it counts me defeat while it's the guy who leaves
and therefore I do not have my reward 4 Draft wins
and I lose my 15000 credits
Already you did nothing for my last Futchamp or I lost 2 ranks because of that
Do not hesitate
EMAIL
Are you going to say again, I'm going to pass the information up and you're not going to do anything?
So...
So no, it is he who left
I am on a pc not a console, I have 600M fiber
and I did not have a blackout because I am on PRS-ORG at the same time and it did not cut
It is he who is leaving
It's just that when too many people leave a match against a player, the game considers it to be him.
This is big shit
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG Support.
I am NAME-M, can I ask for your first name please to start?
Hello NAME-M me it's NAME-M
I have a problem with my PRS-ORG account.
I do not have access to the transfer market on the application or on the web.
On the other hand, the access works directly on the game
NAME-M
Would it be possible to help me please sir?
I'm fine thanks i hope you too
Alor on the PRS-ORG it's ALPHANUMERICID-
I made the mistake of wanting to buy credits was on my first account.
So I recreated a PRS-ORG account in order to be able to fully enjoy the game, without breaking the rules this time though.
Except that suddenly the access was not put on this new account
I play with the Lyon team being Lyonnais in was mode.
I really like the very complete package for its 81 rating.
I do the dcé to have it in POTM at this moment
And you your favorite player?
Very good player indeed mbappe, you have good tastes.
He has made a very good start to the season in addition with PRS-ORG
It is I who thank you for taking the time to help me.
Did you find an explanation for my transfer market
I've been playing for several days and unfortunately nothing is done yet
Alright, I'll keep having fun then.
The main thing is to have access to it on console.
But the app is very handy for managing remotely.
Thank you very much NAME-M anyway.
I wish you a very nice day.
Thank you for your help and kindness
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG Support.

Hello,
rock
Quite simply I think
I have preco BF 2042 on October 6 in gold edition
And today I have a message wanting to install it like: "Unfortunately, it seems that a billing problem has arisen with your pre-order"
So I go to the PRS-ORG site
And the order is tagged "being processed"
I realize that PayPal was never charged
And so I change my payment method
I now want my game to be simply unlocked
EMAIL
I see it but with marked "Pre-order failure"
PRS-ORG
It doesn't change the problem
I just did the manipulation
And I still have pre-order failure
So can't you reissue the command or something?
Because I have correctly entered my payment method and I still do not see the problem being unlocked
I even have a notification in PRS-ORG telling me that I can play
I relaunched PRS-ORG
I think this is sufficient after deleting the cache
And if I restart it I lose our conversation
Via chat
Hello, I would like to receive payments on 2 different accounts.
I have already sent several messages about this.
I just ordered a 2nd box, but it is sending me back to the same account.

I received an email this morning telling me that my order was on its way.
my email address: EMAIL
Thank you.
This morning's email was in French, but I usually receive them in Dutch.
Can you change this so that I have all communications in French.
Thank you.

At first I received the emails in French, but the last ones, no.
I have sent several messages about this without success.
Thank you for contacting PRS-ORG Support.

Good evening, I'm coming back because I think I identified the problem
I only "lag" on PRS-ORG currently and I wanted to see at the level of my accounting with the server if there is a problem or not
because I have signs that I have packet loss while I looked on teamspeak and I have no loss since 50 min
as you can see in this picture
URL
Good evening, not too much since I'm bugging a lot and this is my last solution to come to you.
:(
URL here is one of the videos of my problem
URL
And sometimes I have no sign of packet loss at the top yet I have many lags
Is it a problem with me or with the game?
Because i'm going crazy
You are going to fix this via a patch I suppose?
But in how long?
Because I can't play in these conditions at all and no longer in a pro club either
Thanks to you, I hope it will be ok :)
Good evening and thank you
Good luck for this week

or EMAIL
or EMAIL
with PRS-ORG never any problem every time it's PRS-ORG that bugs

Hello,
I have a big problem reading books uploaded from a library, a problem I recently encountered.
The book is uploaded from the library to my computer via PRS-ORG.
I have a license on the computer and I installed it on my PRS-ORG reader.
I connect the reader to the computer to retrieve the book, the content is imported.
I eject my reader well before disconnecting it from the computer and I see briefly the cover of the downloaded book appearing on the reader.
Then, when I want to open the downloaded book to read it, a message appears indicating that my reader is not allowed to open this book because it should be allowed again with our PRS-ORG ID and re-import it.
In the settings, I have PRS-ORG with my email address and so I have this permission.
What should I do ?
EMAIL
I don't buy a book but I download it from the library.
The latest one today is N.E.O.
- Volume 1: The fall of the iron sun by NAME-M.
It seems to me.
In any case, I am connected in wi-fi and automatic synchronization is activated.
I don't know when the last synchronization took place.
The date and time are correct.
How can this affect the authorization?
I tried again before contacting you.
I have uninstall permission and discount.
I will try again.
For now I have ADE 4.5.11 What I don't understand why now!
It will be almost 1 year since I use it.
What are the plant parameters?
hello I did not receive the payment of 3 Februaryy

Hi, I'm NAME-M, PRS-ORG's virtual assistant.
🤖 I'm here to help you with questions about your payment terminal, payments and more!
For the more complicated ones, I put you in touch with a human.
So what can I do for you PRS-ORG?
You have opted for payments on the PRS-ORG Card.
The cashed funds are therefore available on your card the day after a transaction, this is also valid for the weekend.
Please note: If the transaction you are waiting for has been completed before the card payments are set up, then the funds will be paid to the registered bank account and not to the PRS-ORG Card.
Changes in payment method and frequency do not affect past transactions.

It's been several team clash matches that I get disconnected and therefore count as a defeat when I win 3 or 4 to 0
it makes me lose ranks and therefore move forward for my team
I repeat I have disconnection during team clash matches
I am disconnected and therefore loss of the match while I win this match
it was not online
so nothing to see
I'm in team clash so it's your game that decorates me ...

I'm fed up I play the game and I get tricked ... I really have the impression that you don't give a damn about players like me
without counting the times where I find myself at 8 or at nine times from the start of the match because of a bug ....

I bought yesterday the ebook "Noyaux et particules: physique subatomique, vol.

I would therefore like the reimbursement of the corresponding 15.99€
Thanking you in advance

This is the one

Hello NAME-M,

It's fine, thank you despite the fact that I'm having a technical problem with the PRS-ORG game on PC
Indeed for more than an hour, I can not go to the transfer market to buy a player
How is it possible?
Thanking you in advance and waiting for your response.
It seems to me that this is a security block undertaken by PRS-ORG against hackers and bots.
But I am not one.
It is this one.
when i hit the PRS-ORG transfer market
when launching the search for the player I want
that tells me
"a communication problem has occurred with the PRS-ORG servers, try again later"
all the rest of the game works except the transfer market where it indicates this message to me and ejects me from the transfer market
Very well thank you.
thank you for your advice
Please speak to a consultant

Hello,
Books purchased and present in my library are not readable on my e-Reader
#EMAIL#
9/01/#NUMBER#
The #PRS_ORG# of #NAME#
My e-Reader tells me that it is impossible to open the document when I want to read 2 of the books in my library.
Synchronization does not change anything

No; books are affected
yes.
yes.

Okay.
Hello,
I bought the ebook Ascendance of a bookworm Part 3 Volume 3.
After downloading it to my eReader (via the #PRS_ORG# app), all I get is a preview, not the full book.
I tried removing it and downloading it again, but I always get the same result.
How do I download the correct book?
Thank you
#EMAIL#
It should be noted that I make the purchases via #PRS_ORG#
This was on January 4
It's a #PRS_ORG# eReader
#PRS_ORG# if I remember correctly
yes, that's right
Is it on the eReader menu?
I don't see that option.
OR do I have to do it with the #PRS_ORG# app on my PC?
Oh yes, I see it on the app, I'm launching it
Done.
Yes, thank you, I had not checked the device information, but the account section
But nothing changed regarding the book, do I have to remove it and download it again?
Done
I signed out from the app and the eReader, waited for 3 minutes, and signed in on the app again
I use the app to retrieve the books on the eReader because I'm having wifi connection issues
The app has just finished resyncing, but nothing has changed regarding the book
It's there, but it's still a preview and not the full book, nothing has changed
After singing in again, I didn't do anything with this particular ebook, but the app seems to have downloaded at least some of them on its own
Should I remove it and download it again?
Sorry, I started before I saw your message
The ebook is here again, I'll wait for your message before doing anything
I'm offline
Syncing is over, still the same issue
The book is incomplete, it's only an excerpt and not the full book
the ebook opens (and it has always opened), but the content is not the full book
on the app
but on Monday I retrieved it on the eReader and it was the same
No, I didn't connect it while we were doing these actions
I can connect it, but if the book does not show correctly in the app, I guess it will be the same on the eReader
The table of contents is only the Cover and the Preview, and it's only 25 pages
uninstalled, reinstalled, no change
I don't think the installation is the problem here, the comments on the book at the store show that I'm not the only one facing this problem
No change
Ok, I tried to contact them first, but I didn't succeed
Yes, it makes sense
Thanks anyway, have a nice day
I ordered 2 books yesterday and I have their invoice.
I can't download one of these 2 books, or it has a problem, after several syncs.
What should I do?
Thank you.
#NAME#
#EMAIL#
The book I can't download is "The apprentice".
What do you mean?

NO.

I found "Repair".
It's being done on my e-reader.
I'll let you know as soon as it's done.
It always takes some time with the #PRS_ORG#!
Great, that's OK.
Thank you very much.
And have a good evening.
Hello,
I can't open 2 books that I purchased recently and uploaded to my #PRS_ORG# reader?
I've synced it but the problem remains

I'd be grateful for any advice on what to do.

Could it be that I didn't make the purchase in the right country
So what should I do?

I did that before contacting you
Should I do it again?
I signed out
Yes
Should I sign in again?
Yes
Ok, I'll go there
And then I sign in?
Yes
I must have closed it by mistake
But I'm back
It worked, my book just showed up, thanks 🙏
I'm really happy 😊
No, thank you very much for your time and patience
Happy new year #NUMBER#

Hello,
my daughter has her own #PRS_ORG#, I would like her to have access to my account so that she can read my books, but I can't change her account (created by my husband)
my account: #PRS_ORG#
in my daughter's settings, the address is that of my husband: #PRS_ORG#
I would like my daughter to have access to my account
I should sign out on my daughter's eReader and sign in again?
I'll try
it's signed out
done.
I'm logging into your account
I forgot my password!
What is the password?
does it consist of numbers?
for my #PRS_ORG# account
my computer signs in automatically
what if I click forgotten password on my daughter's #PRS_ORG#?
I forgot my password and I can't change it on the #NAME# account
so it doesn't work
I do want the link
I just changed the password, it doesn't work with my daughter's #PRS_ORG#
done.
It says "account not found"
yes, everything is correct
no, it tells me to sign in with #PRS_ORG#
no, I don't see how to do that
should I leave this screen by selecting the arrow in the top left corner?
in "more connection options" there is #PRS_ORG# or #PRS_ORG#
should I select #PRS_ORG#?
in a long list
THANK YOU, #NAME#!!!!!
IT WORKED!!!!!
